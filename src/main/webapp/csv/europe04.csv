The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

Most changes are Positive changes, understood as areas of urban sprawl (i.e. new UMZ areas between 2000 and 2006), while negative changes describe the reduction of a certain UMZ between 2000 and 2006 (warning: some negative changes might be due to different interpretations between 2000-2006).","The methodology described below for changes between 1990 and 2000 applies by analogy to changes between 2000 and 2006.   UMZ Changes have been calculated as well, by unioning both UMZ90 and UMZ00 and looking for those polygons existing only in one year (i.e. 1990 or 2000). Most changes are Positive changes, understood as areas of urban sprawl (i.e. new UMZ areas between 1990 and 2000), while negative changes describe the reduction of a certain UMZ between 1990 and 2000 (warning: some negative changes might be due to different interpretations between 1990-2000). Only countries with CLC in both years have changes in UMZ Steps to follow: 1. Create a file geodatabase to keep the geometries 2. Union UMZ 1990 – 2000. Output:UMZ90_00_Full 3. Select (  FID_UMZ1990  = -1 OR  FID_UMZ2000  = -1) 4. Export the selection. Output:UMZ90_00_FULL_select.shp 5. Selection of the real changes. Erasing    a.

With the help of CLC data it is possible to provide support for protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive. CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Input data: Corine Land Cover 2000 revised (file geodatabase v10)   Rasterisation using gdal_rasterize from GDAL 1.9.0 command line utilities - Loop through the list of layers, and generate the layers as defined there, see the shell script [0] and the list of layers (layer_code.list) [1].  - Thereby translating the 3-digit CLC codes (111...999) into grid codes within the 8-bit  range (0...44), see clc_legend.csv [2] - And eventually adding the usual CLC colour table to the generated GeoTIFF, by using a pre-defined vrt file, see [3]   [0]: docs/rasterize.sh [1]: docs/layer_code.list [2]: docs/clc_legend.csv [3]: docs/legend_250.vrt","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","","","","","",Land cover,environment]

A water stress indicator is defined as the total withdrawal of freshwater resources in relation to the long-term average availability of the freshwater water resources within a river (sub)basin. One of the most important indicators for water scarcity or water stress is the water exploitation index (WEI) or water stress indicator (w.t.a.), which is defined as the total water withdrawals-to-water availability ratio within a river basin. Water scarcity can be the result of intensive water use, low water availability (climate driven) or a combination of these pressures. The indicator provides to policy makers a quick overview of areas that may encounter water shortage problems. WEI or a w.t.a.-value between 0.0 and 0.2 is considered a low water stress, WEI between 0.2 and 0.4medium water stress, and a value greater than 0.4 severe water stress. This variant of the water exploitation index is defined as the ratio of water withdrawals in all sectors to water availability. Annual WEI is calculated on a river basin level for the baseline and the 2050s. Here, baseline conditions are defined as water availability averaged over the climate normal period 1961-90 and water withdrawals for the year 2005. For the 2050s, water availability is averaged over the period 2041-2070 (2050s) and calculated as the median of the hydrological simulations. Total water withdrawals are represented by two different socio-economic scenarios, the SCENES scenarios “Economy First” (EcF) and “Sustainability Eventually” (SuE).","The water withdrawals are calculated by WaterGAP, and results for the SCENES scenarios “Economy First” (EcF) and “Sustainability Eventually” (SuE) are selected (Annex 3). Water availability is computed as the median of an ensemble of LISFLOOD simulations driven by climate projections of 11 different GCM-RCM combinations (see Annex 3, Table 1) for the period 2041-2070 (representing 2050s). The climate projections are taken from the ENSEMBLES project and are based on the SRES A1B scenario (Annex 3).","urn:ogc:def:crs:::EPSG:4258","","","","","","","OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map",water management,water stress,WEI,ClimWatAdapt,water,Atmospheric conditions,climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere]

This layer contains UMZ delineations for Europe, based on Corine Land Cover database. During 2012, the UMZ methodology was updated in order to correct errors derived for the water course as join elements between urban areas. Previous version applied over CLC v15 (and previous version) joined many small urban areas due to the water presence. This fact was erroneous from the landscape and urban perspective as most of those areas remain as urban-rural typologies. Moreover, water courses cannot be considered as roads from the urban morphological view (either from the commuting point of understanding). This new version, known as v16, corrected this effect in the majority of cases.","An Urban Morphological Zone can be defined as “A set of urban areas laying less than 200m apart”. Those urban areas are defined from land cover classes contributing to the urban tissue and function.

It is an ecological network of protected areas, set up to ensure the survival of Europe's most valuable species and habitats. Natura 2000 is based on the 1979 Bird's Directive and the 1992 Habitat's Directive. The green infrastructure it provides safeguards numerous ecosystem services and ensures that Europe's natural systems remain healthy and resilient.   Natura 2000 is an ecological network composed of sites designated under the Birds Directive (Special Protection Areas, SPAs) and the Habitats Directive (Sites of Community Importance, SCIs, and Special Areas of Conservation, SACs).   For each Natura 2000 site, national authorities have submitted a standard data form (SDF) that contains an extensive description of the site and its ecology. The European Topic Centre for Biological Diversity (ETC/BD), based in Paris, is responsible for validating this data and creating an EU wide descriptive database.   The European database on Natura 2000 sites consists of data submitted by Member States to the European Commission. This data is subject
to a regular validation and updating process. After validation a new EU-wide Natura 2000 database is released. The date of release of a new EU-wide database does not guarantee that the data has been regularly and uniformly updated by Member States.   The spatial data (borders of sites) submitted by each Member State is validated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and linked to the descriptive data. Any problems identified during this process are brought to the attention of the concerned Member States.    There are specific terms and conditions relating to the use of downloaded boundary data within the United Kingdom.  If you intend to use the UK data you must first agree to the end user licence http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-5232.   Please note that some Member States have submitted sensitive information that has been filtered out of this database. The following Member States have submitted sensitive information: Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Malta, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden and United Kingdom. This concerns mainly species associated to specific sites. All reference to these species has been removed from the related sites. Certain descriptive fields, possibly mentioning the presence of these species, have also been removed.

A water stress indicator is defined as the total withdrawal of freshwater resources in relation to the long-term average availability of the freshwater water resources within a river (sub)basin. One of the most important indicators for water scarcity or water stress is the water exploitation index (WEI) or water stress indicator (w.t.a.), which is defined as the total water withdrawals-to-water availability ratio within a river basin. Water scarcity can be the result of intensive water use, low water availability (climate driven) or a combination of these pressures. The indicator provides to policy makers a quick overview of areas that may encounter water shortage problems. WEI or a w.t.a.-value between 0.0 and 0.2 is considered a low water stress, WEI between 0.2 and 0.4medium water stress, and a value greater than 0.4 severe water stress. This variant of the water exploitation index is defined as the ratio of water withdrawals in all sectors to water availability. Annual WEI is calculated on a river basin level for the baseline and the 2050s. Here, baseline conditions are defined as water availability averaged over the climate normal period 1961-90 and water withdrawals for the year 2005. For the 2050s, water availability is averaged over the period 2041-2070 (2050s) and calculated as the median of the hydrological simulations. Total water withdrawals are represented by two different socio-economic scenarios, the SCENES scenarios “Economy First” (EcF) and “Sustainability Eventually” (SuE).","The water withdrawals are calculated by WaterGAP, and results for the SCENES scenarios “Economy First” (EcF) and “Sustainability Eventually” (SuE) are selected (Annex 3). Water availability is computed as the median of an ensemble of LISFLOOD simulations driven by climate projections of 11 different GCM-RCM combinations (see Annex 3, Table 1) for the period 2041-2070 (representing 2050s). The climate projections are taken from the ENSEMBLES project and are based on the SRES A1B scenario (Annex 3).","urn:ogc:def:crs:::EPSG:4258","","","","","","","OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map",water management,water stress,WEI,ClimWatAdapt,water,Atmospheric conditions,climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere]

It is an ecological network of protected areas, set up to ensure the survival of Europe's most valuable species and habitats. Natura 2000 is based on the 1979 Bird's Directive and the 1992 Habitat's Directive. The green infrastructure it provides safeguards numerous ecosystem services and ensures that Europe's natural systems remain healthy and resilient.   Natura 2000 is an ecological network composed of sites designated under the Birds Directive (Special Protection Areas, SPAs) and the Habitats Directive (Sites of Community Importance, SCIs, and Special Areas of Conservation, SACs).   For each Natura 2000 site, national authorities have submitted a standard data form (SDF) that contains an extensive description of the site and its ecology. The European Topic Centre for Biological Diversity (ETC/BD), based in Paris, is responsible for validating this data and creating an EU wide descriptive database.   The European database on Natura 2000 sites consists of data submitted by Member States to the European Commission. This data is subject
to a regular validation and updating process. After validation a new EU-wide Natura 2000 database is released. The date of release of a new EU-wide database does not guarantee that the data has been regularly and uniformly updated by Member States.   The spatial data (borders of sites) submitted by each Member State is validated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and linked to the descriptive data. Any problems identified during this process are brought to the attention of the concerned Member States.    There are specific terms and conditions relating to the use of downloaded boundary data within the United Kingdom.

The 7-day minimum flow period eliminates the day-to-day variations in river flow. It is obtained by moving an averaging window with an interval of 7 days over the discharge time series. For each year, the minimum was extracted from the smoothed discharge time series, resulting in a sample of 30 yearly minima for each period. To estimate the probability of extreme low river flows a Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution (Coles, 2001; Katz et al., 2002) was fitted to the annual minimum values in every river cell using Maximum Likelihood estimation. More details on the methodology can be found in Feyen and Dankers (2009).The indicators for evaluating vulnerability to droughts are based on the hydrological simulations and statistical analysis provided by JRC (Annex 3).

The first GlobCover map successfully demonstrated the usefulness of MERIS time series for operational land cover observation. Jointly supported by theEuropean Space Agency and the European Environmental Agency, the GlobCorine project builds on the GlobCover findings and aims to make the full use of the MERIS time series for frequent land cover monitoring at the pan-European scale. Such an automated approach at 300 m will not identify landscape patterns as precisely as the Corine methodology, but it will significantly shorten the time response and expand the coverage. First, the automated GlobCover processing chain is adjusted towards a more land use oriented classification, compatible with the Corine typology. Second, an automated statistically-based algorithm is proposed to enable to monitor key land dynamics on a regular basis.","n/a","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:4326","","","","","","","",Land cover,environment,geoscientificInformation]

It is a hybrid product based on SRTM and ASTER GDEM data fused by a weighted averaging approach. The EU-DEM is generated as a contiguous dataset devided into 1 degree by 1 degree tiles corresponding to the SRTM naming convention. Ownership of EU-DEM belongs to European Commision, DG Enterprise and Industry.","The EU-DEM data product is derived from an automated data fusion process using SRTM and ASTER GDEM digital surface model (DSM) data. Intermap's NEXTMap Europe dataset is utilized to remove any consistent horizontal bias in the GDEM data. The EU-DEM product is edited to ensure that water features are adequately represented and consistent with the hydrography layer provided by Aerogeodezijos Institutas (AGI) in Kaunas, Lithuania. Residual clouds within the GDEM data are identified and removed same as suspect data extremely differing from the SRTM data. All EU-DEM tiles are edited interactively in a 3D stereo environment. The editing is restricted to the hydrographic features and pits and bumps. In areas above 60 degress North, the EU-DEM generation process is supported by other DEM data sources provided by JRC. Water features are flattened (oceans, lakes) and stepped (rivers) based on the hydrography data produced by AGI.

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.eu.","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered . Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country). National data, when transformed into the common European reference, are introduced into tiled pan-European structure and as final step seamless dataset is produced. In order to achieve production of the real seamless European database, the integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. It consists from edge-matching of land cover polygons from the national databases across national borders done by a verification / re-interpretation of the satellite images in the border regions (2 km wide strip along borders). The satellite images from IMAGE2000. CLC90, CHA00 and CLC00 database were harmonized this way, but the order to priority was as following: CLC2000, both geometric and thematic adaptations of all polygons in a 2 km strip along national boundary lines; CHA00 database to ensure that changes in CLC2000 are consistent with the change database; corrected CLC90 (if provided by the MS); corrections were focused to geometric adaptations in semi-automatical way based on CLC00 and CHA00 databases. Border harmonization step has been skipped for CHA06 and CLC06 datasets. Note: Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology, but has no impact for dataset contents and can be dissolved for data extracts.

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services.

It produces maps, spatial analysis, promotes geo-referencing of statistics and provides user support for Commission users of GIS. GISCO is one of the leaders of the INSPIRE initiative, supporting the implementation of the directive for the establishment of a European Spatial Data Infrastructure. The datasets extracted from GISCO in August 2012 are for the year 2010:   + Administrative boundaries at country level   + Coastlines   + Communes   + EEZ   + NUTS    These metadata are derived from the original metadata records available at Inspire@EC.","The dataset is based on the geometry from EBM v5.0. of EuroGeographics for the members of Eurogeographics, the Global Administrative Units Layer (2008) from FAO (UN) and geometry from the Turkish National Statistical Office. This resulted in a common repository of geometry of which the different datasets were derived. The different scale levels were derived of generalisations of the common repository on 100K scale. This means that within each scale level the feature classes of all these datasets: COMM_2010, NUTS_2010, CNTR_2010, EEZ_2010 and COAS_2010, are fully coherent and compliant. Each scale level in the CNTR_2010 dataset consists of 2 feature classes (regions and boundaries) The boundaries and regions are related to each other through a relationship table. In addition to the region and boundary feature classes there is also 1 label feature class which is scale independent. For each CNTR in the region feature class there is exactly 1 label. Further information on the validity and lineage is available in the database manual on the INSPIRE@EC group on CIRCABC. https://circabc.europa.eu/w/browse/bf8ae55b-a09b-4f24-a0b8-1f5784e0080c","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:4258","","","","","","","",Administrative units,administrative boundary,boundaries]

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized. The resolution of the data is 100 x 100 and 250 x 250 metres (change grids 100 x 100 metres).CHANGES:Version 13 (02/2010) Production date: February 16th, 2010 This is the 13th CLC grid update and 5nd version containing also data from CLC2006 update (36 countries - only UK, CH and GR data still missing from complete CLC2006 coverage).

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized. The resolution of the data is 100 x 100 and 250 x 250 metres (change grids 100 x 100 metres).CHANGES:Version 13 (02/2010) Production date: February 16th, 2010 This is the 13th CLC grid update and 5nd version containing also data from CLC2006 update (36 countries - only UK, CH and GR data still missing from complete CLC2006 coverage).

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

MPAs are understood as areas for which protective, conservation, restorative or precautionary measures have been instituted for the purpose of protecting and conserving species, habitats, ecosystems or ecological processes of the marine environment.  ------ Abstract derived from the abstract provided together with the dataset.","Lineage provided with the dataset. ------------ One of the tools that can be used to ensure the sustainable use and protection and conservation of marine biological diversity and its ecosystems is the implementation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Within OSPAR, MPAs are understood as areas for which protective, conservation, restorative or precautionary measures have been instituted for the purpose of protecting and conserving species, habitats, ecosystems or ecological processes of the marine environment. The aims of the OSPAR network of MPAs are: * to protect, conserve and restore species, habitats and ecological processes which have been adversely affected by human activities; * to prevent degradation of, and damage to, species, habitats and ecological processes, following the precautionary principle; * to protect and conserve areas that best represent the range of species, habitats and ecological processes in the maritime area. Fuller details of the sites that Contracting Parties have reported to OSPAR are held in the OSPAR MPA database (http://www.ospar.org/html_documents/ospar/html/ospar_mpa-db_populated_2009-06-01.zip). Reporting of MPAs: MPAs selected by Contracting Parties as components of the OSPAR network can be reported using the OSPAR nomination database (Latest version: July 2008). Completed versions of the database should be sent to the OSPAR Secretariat and to the lead country, Germany (Mr Tim Packeiser - tim.packeiser@bfn-vilm.de). Contracting Parties should also complete the implementation reporting format for Recommendation 2003/3 when they submit reports of selected MPAs or develop management plans or management measures for sites within the network. It is recommended that any proposals for MPAs in areas outside national jurisdiction should be submitted in the first instance in paper format using the following nomination proforma.

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized. The resolution of the data is 100 x 100 and 250 x 250 metres (change grids 100 x 100 metres).

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services.

Future Q95 is then compared to the baseline value (= threshold) and assigned to another flow rate (Q90). The assessment is performed according to three classes: 1. no risk if Q95 (2050) > Q95 (baseline)2. medium risk if Q95 (2050) < Q95 (baseline) and Q90 (2050) > Q95 (baseline)3. high risk if Q95 (baseline) > Q90 (2050).","not available","urn:ogc:def:crs:::EPSG:4258","","","","","","","OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map",water management,hydropower,electricity,infrastructure,ClimWatAdapt,water,Atmospheric conditions,climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere]

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized. The resolution of the data is 100 x 100 and 250 x 250 metres (change grids 100 x 100 metres).CHANGES:Version 13 (02/2010) Production date: February 16th, 2010 This is the 13th CLC grid update and 5nd version containing also data from CLC2006 update (36 countries - only UK, CH and GR data still missing from complete CLC2006 coverage).

This layer contains UMZ delineations for Europe, based on Corine Land Cover database. During 2012, the UMZ methodology was updated in order to correct errors derived for the water course as join elements between urban areas. Previous version applied over CLC v15 (and previous version) joined many small urban areas due to the water presence. This fact was erroneous from the landscape and urban perspective as most of those areas remain as urban-rural typologies. Moreover, water courses cannot be considered as roads from the urban morphological view (either from the commuting point of understanding). This new version, known as v16, corrected this effect in the majority of cases.","An Urban Morphological Zone can be defined as “A set of urban areas laying less than 200m apart”. Those urban areas are defined from land cover classes contributing to the urban tissue and function. The Corine Land Cover classes (Figure 1) used to build the Urban Morphological Zone dataset are the following ones: • Core Classes o 111 – Continuous urban fabric o 112 – Discontinuous urban fabric o 121 – Industrial or commercial units o 141 – Green urban areas • Enlarged core classes, CLC Classes 123 (Port areas), 124 (Airports) and 142 (Sport and leisure facilities), are also considered if they are neighbours to the core classes or to one of them touching the core classes. • Road and rail networks, CLC class 122 when neighbours to the enlarged core classes, roads and rails will be included (cut by 300m buffer) as part of the UMZ due to their artificial nature and connectivity properties. • Water courses, CLC class 511, when neighbours to the enlarged core classes and acting as a link between them, they are selected by this fact. • Forests & scrub, CLC classes 311,312,313,322,323,324, when they are completely within the core classes.

The EUHYDRO do not cover the requirement for EEA coastline. The EUHYDRO gaps are in Iceland, Canarias, Madeira, Azores, small islands (not represented in EUDEM) and the northern of Black Sea. The creation process was focused on generating the coastline as line dataset and, later, as a secondary product, defining the polygon layer sea-land. The fundamental step into the workflow was the selection of sea features using a water mask polygon (value in EUHYDRO datasets = 255). The inland water bodies (freshwaters) are rejected by this criteria, except the water bodies connected, at least by one point, to the sea (it is the cases of some transitional water bodies). A few manual amendments to the dataset were necessary to meet requirements from EU Nature Directives, Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

With the help of CLC data it is possible to provide support for protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive.    CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized. The resolution of the data is 100 x 100 and 250 x 250 metres (change grids 100 x 100 metres).","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","","","","","",Land cover,environment,geoscientificInformation]

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

It is an ecological network of protected areas, set up to ensure the survival of Europe's most valuable species and habitats. Natura 2000 is based on the 1979 Birds Directive and the 1992 Habitats Directive.   Natura 2000 is an ecological network composed of sites designated under the Birds Directive (Special Protection Areas, SPAs) and the Habitats Directive (Sites of Community Importance, SCIs, and Special Areas of Conservation, SACs).   For each Natura 2000 site, national authorities have submitted a standard data form (SDF) that contains an extensive description of the site and its ecology. The European Topic Centre for Biological Diversity (ETC/BD), based in Paris, is responsible for validating these datasets and for creating an EU wide descriptive database .   The European database on Natura 2000 sites consists of data submitted by Member States to the European Commission. The European database is generally updated once per year, so as to take into account any updating of the content of the national databases by Member States. After validation a new EU-wide Natura 2000 database is released.  However, the release of a new EU-wide database does not provide any guarantee that a particular national dataset has recently been updated.   The spatial data (borders of sites) submitted by each Member State is validated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and linked to the descriptive data. Any problems identified during this process are brought to the attention of the concerned Member States.   There are specific terms and conditions relating to the use of downloaded boundary data within the United Kingdom. If you intend to use the UK data you must first agree to the end user licence http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-5232.   Please note that some Member States have submitted sensitive information that has been filtered out of this database. The following Member States have submitted sensitive information: Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Poland, Spain and Sweden. This concerns mainly species associated to specific sites. All reference to these species has been removed from the related sites. If this sensitive information is necessary to your field of research, please contact the Member States' administrations individually. You can find a compiled list of national or regional Natura 2000 websites at the following address:   http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/db_gis/index_en.htm#sites","Member States update Natura 2000 spatial data continuously.

It is a geographical information system of the European hydrographical systems with a full topological information. Ecrins is a composite system made from the CCM developed by the JRC, Corine land Cover, WFD reporting elements, etc. It is organised from a layer of 181,071 “functional elementary catchments (FECs)” which average size is ~62 km2, fully connected with explicit identifier (ID) relationships and upstream area. Catchments are grouped as sub-basins, river basin districts (actual and functional to meet hydrographical continuity). The catchments are as well organised according to their sea shore of emptying to meet Marine Strategy delineations. Catchments are drained by 1,348,163 river segments, sorted as “main drains” (connecting together the FECs) and secondary drains (internal to a FEC). river segments mimic the natural drainage, however fulfilling the topological constraint of “0,1 or 2 upstreams, single or 0 downstream”. Each segment is populated with distance to the sea, to ease further processing. They are connected to elementary catchments and nodes documented with altitude. Segments are as well documented with a “dummy river code”, fully populated that earmark each segment with the most distant to the outlet in each drainage basin and, everywhere this has been possible, with a “true river” ID based on river naming. A layer of lakes and dams has been elaborated. Lakes polygons (70,847) are taken from Corine Land cover , WFD Art. 13 and in some cases, from CCM “water layer”. Lakes inlets and outlets are set with the segment ID and where relevant, the dams making the lake is documented. All lakes which depths and volume was found have been updated. Version 1.0 here presented still contain some topological errors (e.g. incorrect segment branching), because inaccurate geometry. They are noted and a correction procedure is underway.","Product is based on CCM River and Catchment Database, version 2.1 (vector, lines and points data sets). Coastal definition has been substituted by SeaVox se delineation adjusted to CCM shore line. Lakes polygons are taken from Corine land Cover 2006, XFD Art 13 deliveries and to a lesser extend from CCM water layer. Lakes relevance has been checked against ERM Euroregional maps(layers 2010). River names taken from many sources: ERM, Wikipedia, WFD deliveries and water bodies deliveries, EEA data base on dams, etc. Dams have been taken from several sources: Icold, French ministry of energy, public web sites. Their position has been found by the EEA using a web based tool applied to GoogleEarth, completed by Eionet deliveries. Corrections are proposed by innumerable source, of which EU member states (as provision of the water bodies) and consultants, primarily Pöyry during systematic calculation of discharges at segment level.","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/ds_resolveuid/401cd8dc-349e-4b38-8acc-d862460d0491","","","","",Hydrography,hydrography,inlandWaters]

Coastal FECs have the following characteristics: they may have 0 to several outlets, they have no upstream FEC and they touch a terminal recipient (sea or endorheic lake). They ID starts by ‘W’. The continental FECs may have an outlet, but at least one upstream if the FEC is terminal. Continental FECs belong to three categories: upstream (no upstream FEC), intermediates (upstream(s) and one downstream or terminal (upstream(s) and no downstream. The database contains a single table of features, named C_Zhyd that contains the Ecrins version to which these FECs refer, the FEC ID and attribute values.

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized. The resolution of the data is 100 x 100 and 250 x 250 metres (change grids 100 x 100 metres).CHANGES:Version 13 (02/2010) Production date: February 16th, 2010 This is the 13th CLC grid update and 5nd version containing also data from CLC2006 update (36 countries - only UK, CH and GR data still missing from complete CLC2006 coverage).

River segments mimic the surface rivers on a simplified way, allowing simple journeying. As for FECs, but completed because of the process, any segment may have 0, 1 or 2 upstream and single downstream. The reason for single upstream is because spurious branching segments have been removed (~160,000) from CCM source during the Ecrins making. The segments mimic rivers that are cultural, not simply defined objects. The “dummy rivers” (ID is CGENELIN) branches together all the segments which spring is most distant to the sea, then second most distant and connecting to this first set of segments, etc. the “true rivers” are those sets of segments having the same name, disregarding translation (segments on the Rheine, Rhin, etc. have same river ID). Name of true rivers is hosted in the EcrGaz database. Dummy rivers maybe sorted out as “main drains” that either connect FECs together (continental FECs) or are the most important in a coastal FEC. Main drains are hence the potential population of “WFD large rivers”, since the FEC average size is ~1/10 of the threshold catchment size of main rivers. The geodatabases contains two feature classes: C_Tr where all segments lines are. This table links to FECs, since a FEC may contain several segments. Feature class C_node contains all nodes, making implicit the flow direction that is identified in C_tr by FNode (from node) and TNode (to node). Field River_ID links to flat table RivNames in EcrGaz personal geodatabase Full documentation is in EEA technical report 9/2012, downloadable from the EEA website.","This dataset is derived from the segments and nodes data sets produced by CCM. Significant reprocessing has been carried out to clean the data sets, create hierarchy, populate incomplete fields (e.g. distance to the sea), create dummy rivers and, last but most important, give names to rivers. A systematic check of branching errors is currently being carried out to identify topological errors (a->B and should be A->C) based on discharge computation and name matching.","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/ds_resolveuid/401cd8dc-349e-4b38-8acc-d862460d0491","","","","",Hydrography,hydrography,inlandWaters]

With the help of CLC data it is possible to provide support for protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive. CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services.

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.eu.","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered . Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country). National data, when transformed into the common European reference, are introduced into tiled pan-European structure and as final step seamless dataset is produced. In order to achieve production of the real seamless European database, the integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. It consists from edge-matching of land cover polygons from the national databases across national borders done by a verification / re-interpretation of the satellite images in the border regions (2 km wide strip along borders). The satellite images from IMAGE2000. CLC90, CHA00 and CLC00 database were harmonized this way, but the order to priority was as following: CLC2000, both geometric and thematic adaptations of all polygons in a 2 km strip along national boundary lines; CHA00 database to ensure that changes in CLC2000 are consistent with the change database; corrected CLC90 (if provided by the MS); corrections were focused to geometric adaptations in semi-automatical way based on CLC00 and CHA00 databases. Border harmonization step has been skipped for CHA06 and CLC06 datasets. Note: Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology, but has no impact for dataset contents and can be dissolved for data extracts.

With the help of CLC data it is possible to provide support for protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive.    CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized. The resolution of the data is 100 x 100 and 250 x 250 metres (change grids 100 x 100 metres).","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","","","","","",Land cover,environment,geoscientificInformation]

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.eu.","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered . Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country). National data, when transformed into the common European reference, are introduced into tiled pan-European structure and as final step seamless dataset is produced. In order to achieve production of the real seamless European database, the integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. It consists from edge-matching of land cover polygons from the national databases across national borders done by a verification / re-interpretation of the satellite images in the border regions (2 km wide strip along borders). The satellite images from IMAGE2000. CLC90, CHA00 and CLC00 database were harmonized this way, but the order to priority was as following: CLC2000, both geometric and thematic adaptations of all polygons in a 2 km strip along national boundary lines; CHA00 database to ensure that changes in CLC2000 are consistent with the change database; corrected CLC90 (if provided by the MS); corrections were focused to geometric adaptations in semi-automatical way based on CLC00 and CHA00 databases. Border harmonization step has been skipped for CHA06 and CLC06 datasets. Note: Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology, but has no impact for dataset contents and can be dissolved for data extracts.

Irrigation consumption refers to the part of the irrigation water that is really “consumed” by the crops and evapotranspirates (net irrigation requirements).The amount of water used for irrigation has been calculated for the base year based on the baseline climate (1961-90). It must be noted that the future irrigation water requirements were calculated within SCENES, i.e. the climate change input differs from the climate data used in the ClimWatAdapt framework because another emission scenario and different GCM output were applied. The assessment is performed on the river basin level for average annual conditions as well as for the summer season (JJA). This indicator does not consider the reduction of natural flow by upstream consumptive use, thus the water resources are only available for irrigation.By using this indicator, it is assumed that a drainage basin suffers from severe water stress if c.t.a. > 0.3 or, in other words, if irrigation consumption exceeds 40% of reliable annual (or seasonal) water availability. A c.t.a. below 0.3 indicates low to mid water stress. The thresholds are chosen arbitrarily but have been derived from EEA (2003) which shows a figure for the water consumption index ranging from (almost) zero to 30% in Europe. According to EEA (2003), the average water consumption index in Europe is 3%.","The annual water consumption for irrigation is modelled by WaterGAP. The water consumption for irrigation during June, July and August is calculated by dividing the annual water consumption for irrigation by 4. The water availability during June, July and August is modelled by LISFLOOD.","urn:ogc:def:crs:::EPSG:4258","","","","","","","OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map",water management,water stress,WEI,ClimWatAdapt,water,Atmospheric conditions,climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere]

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized. The resolution of the data is 100 x 100 and 250 x 250 metres (change grids 100 x 100 metres).CHANGES:Version 13 (02/2010) Production date: February 16th, 2010 This is the 13th CLC grid update and 5nd version containing also data from CLC2006 update (36 countries - only UK, CH and GR data still missing from complete CLC2006 coverage).

With respect to soil degradation, most concerns about erosion are related to accelerated erosion, where the natural rate has been significantly increased mostly by human activity. Soil erosion by water is a widespread problem throughout Europe. PESERA (Pan European Soil Erosion Risk Assessment) has been created in order to design a model and to handle spatial and temporal data of variable quality and detail and to enable the impacts of agricultural policy, land use and climate changes to be assessed and monitored across Europe. The Pan-European Soil Erosion Risk Assessment - PESERA - uses a process-based and spatially distributed model to quantify soil erosion by water and assess its risk across Europe.

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.eu.","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects.

European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered . Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country).

In order to achieve production of the real seamless European database, the integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders.

Irrigation consumption refers to the part of the irrigation water that is really “consumed” by the crops and evapotranspirates (net irrigation requirements).The amount of water used for irrigation has been calculated for the base year based on the baseline climate (1961-90). It must be noted that the future irrigation water requirements were calculated within SCENES, i.e. the climate change input differs from the climate data used in the ClimWatAdapt framework because another emission scenario and different GCM output were applied. The assessment is performed on the river basin level for average annual conditions as well as for the summer season (JJA). This indicator does not consider the reduction of natural flow by upstream consumptive use, thus the water resources are only available for irrigation.By using this indicator, it is assumed that a drainage basin suffers from severe water stress if c.t.a. > 0.3 or, in other words, if irrigation consumption exceeds 40% of reliable annual (or seasonal) water availability. A c.t.a. below 0.3 indicates low to mid water stress. The thresholds are chosen arbitrarily but have been derived from EEA (2003) which shows a figure for the water consumption index ranging from (almost) zero to 30% in Europe. According to EEA (2003), the average water consumption index in Europe is 3%.","The annual water consumption for irrigation is modelled by WaterGAP. The water consumption for irrigation during June, July and August is calculated by dividing the annual water consumption for irrigation by 4. The water availability during June, July and August is modelled by LISFLOOD.","urn:ogc:def:crs:::EPSG:4258","","","","","","","OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map",water management,agriculture,irrigation,ClimWatAdapt,water,Atmospheric conditions,climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere]

The NUTS geographical information is completed by attribute tables and a set of cartographic help lines to better visualise multipart polygonal regions. The NUTS nomenclature is a hierarchical classification of statistical regions defined by Eurostat. The NUTS classification subdivides the EU economic territory into 3 statistical levels. The Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) was enforced the 11 July 2003. This regulation provided the NUTS classification with a legal background. Since then, 12 new countries joined the European Union. The NUTS regulation was officially enforced in these 12 countries the day of their accession to the EU. A non official NUTS-like classification has been defined for the EFTA countries, Croatia and Turkey. For further information about the NUTS classification please check the RAMON Eurostat site at http://ec.europa.eu/comm/eurostat/ramon/nuts/home_regions_en.html At present, six scale ranges (100K, 1M, 3M, 10M and 20M, 60M) are maintained in the GISCO geodatabase. The polygon and boundary classes delineate the regions while the points provide a label for each region. Associated tables contain basic information such as the region's name. This feature class represents the polygon geometry of the 1:100.000 scale level of the NUTS regions. This shapefile was modified by the ETC-LUSI with the purpose of including this dataset into the LEAC System.","Input Data from GISCO, NUTS 2006 version 010210, in particular the polygon version NUTS_RG_100K_2006 together with NUTS_AT_2006 where all the definitions are stored. The dataset was modified in order to include this information into the LEAC System. Country boundaries for the Balkan countries were extracted from the previous version of LEAC NUTS 2003 (nuts_balkan_countries) and included in this new version. Furthermore other changes were made in order to complete the dataset coverage with islands, lakes, etc. The final dbf table includes all the relationships among different NUTS levels as well as a combination of NUTS 0 2 and 3 called NUTS X. process steps: -Data was disaggregated by the field:  STAT_LEVL_CODE  into Country, NUTS 1, NUTS 2, NUTS 3. -Intersection of the four different layers: NUTS 0, 1, 2 and 3, in order to have all the definitions and relationships in one table.   -Generation of NUTS Definition Tables for NUTS according to the previous definition tables for 2003 used in LEAC cubes.   Some inconsistencies were found in the original file so they were fixed using the geometries from NUTS 2003 (nuts_balkan_countries). -Some isles were included: Man Island, Faroe Islands, -Some countries were missing or they were part of another countries such as: Monaco (It was included in France territory), San Marino (no data), Vatican City (no data), Andorra (no data), all these errors were corrected. - Boundaries for Balkan countries: Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, Albania, Montenegro, Macedonia, Kosovo, were extracted from  nuts_balkan_countries.shp . - Lakes were extracted from NUTS_BN_100K_2006 Polyline. To complete the dataset missing lakes were extracted from  nuts_balkan_countries.shp  and included in the final version.","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:4258","","","","","","","",Statistical units,environment,geoscientificInformation]

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Input data: Corine Land Cover 2000 vector v16 (file geodatabase v10)   Rasterisation using gdal_rasterize from GDAL 1.9.0 command line utilities - Loop through the list of layers, and generate the layers as defined there, see the shell script [0] and the list of layers (layer_code.list) [1].  - Thereby translating the 3-digit CLC codes (111...999) into grid codes within the 8-bit  range (0...44), see clc_legend.csv [2] - And eventually adding the usual CLC colour table to the generated GeoTIFF, by using a pre-defined vrt file, see [3]   [0]: docs/rasterize.sh [1]: docs/layer_code.list [2]: docs/clc_legend.csv [3]: docs/legend_100.vrt","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/ds_resolveuid/b13985d2-34d3-4310-9d2e-9ddedb86e42f","","","","",Land cover,environment,geoscientificInformation]

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized.

The NUTS nomenclature is a hierarchical classification of statistical regions and subdivides the EU economic territory into regions of three different levels (NUTS 1, 2 and 3, respectively, moving from larger to smaller territorial units). NUTS 1 is the most aggregated level. The NUTS classification has been officially established through Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amendments. A non official NUTS-like classification has been defined for the EFTA countries and candidate countries. An introduction to the NUTS classification is available here: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/nuts_nomenclature/introduction   This data set has been created mainly from the EuroBoundary Map v 5.0 (Eurogeographics), geographic information from TurkStat for Turkey, the Global Administrative Unit Layer from FAO (UN) for Macedonia and a list of communes per statistical region provided by the countries. Six scale ranges (100K, 1M, 3M, 10M and 20M, 60M) are available. The public data set (1M - 60M) is available for download at http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/gisco_Geographical_information_maps/popups/references/administrative_units_statistical_units_1 The full data set (100K - 60M) is available to EEA due to EEA having a valid EBM v5.0 licence.  Coverage is the economical territory of the EU, EFTA countries and candidate countries as in 2010.    These metadata are derived from the original metadata records available at Inspire@EC.","This dataset is based on: EuroBoundaryMap (EBM) v5.0. from EuroGeographics (scale of 1:100.000), Global Administrative Unit Layer (GAUL) 2008 country data from UN/FAO, data from the National Statistical Institute of Turkey (TurkStat), General Register Office for Scotland (GRO) (scale 1:100.000), Digital Chart of the World from ESRI for Kaliningrad, ArcWorld from ESRI for the Aral Sea, the Caspian Sea, some other borders. The different scale levels were derived by generalisation of the 100K scale. This data set consists of 2 feature classes (region polygons and boundaries) per scale level (100k, 1M, 3M, 10M, 20M, 60M). In addition there is also a label feature class (scale independent). This labelpoint feature class was created with a label inside each NUTS region at the 3 NUTS levels (1 - 3) and countries. Furthermore two line feature classes were created: one feature class for cartograhic joiners to identify where NUTS areas have one or more enclaves and a second line feature class for cartographic separators, to identify where the NUTS limits are in the sea. The arcs of two latter feature classes are only useful for cartographic purposes and are not meant to identify actual administrative or statistical boundaries stretching into the sea or any other significance. The boundaries and regions are related to each other through a relationship table. Associated tables contain basic information such as the region&apos;s name. The 5 small scale feature classes should be used exclusively for cartographic purposes. This data set is consistent at all scales with the following data sets: &quot;Communes 2010 – European Commission, Eurostat/GISCO&quot;, &quot;Countries 2010, European Commission - Eurostat/GISCO&quot;, &quot;Coastlines 2010, European Commission - Eurostat/GISCO&quot;, &quot;Exclusive Economic Zones 2010, European Commission - Eurostat/GISCO&quot; .

LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized. The resolution of the data is 100 x 100 and 250 x 250 metres (change grids 100 x 100 metres).CHANGES:Version 13 (02/2010) Production date: February 16th, 2010 This is the 13th CLC grid update and 5nd version containing also data from CLC2006 update (36 countries - only UK, CH and GR data still missing from complete CLC2006 coverage).

The sample grid available here is part of a set of three polygon grids in 1, 10 and 100 kilometres. The grids cover at least country borders and, where applicable, marine Exclusive Economic Zones v7.0, http://www.marineregions.org. Note that the extent of the grid into the marine area does not reflect the extent of the territorial waters.","The reference grids are based on ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection with parameters: latitude of origin 52°N, longitude of origin 10°E, false northing 3210000.0m, false easting 4321000.0m. Origin of the grid is calculated from 0mN 0mE of projection. The method followed the instructions for the EEA fishnet tool described in the EEA GIS guideline available from http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gis. All grids have been created using one of the two scripts available in the scripts subfolder located in the data directory. Their usage is documented in the readme.txt file available in the same subfolder.","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/eea-reference-grids-2","","","","",Geographical grid systems,location]

The structure of the attribute table has been changed in this revised version. The mapping from old field names to new ones is as follows:    NAME -> short_name    ABBRE -> pre_2012    code -> code    label -> name","Biogeographical boundaries were obtained from the EU Member States and from the Emerald Network countries. These were merged together to produce a European wide map of the biogeographical regions independent of political boundaries. A number of the regions were updated during the work under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) and in 2010 the Standing Committee to the Bern Convention adopted a number of changes according to progress in the setting-up of the Emerald Network.   Improved boundaries for the following countries: Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Sweden.   The scale varies inside the dataset. Some regions, e.g. in EU countries, are 1:1 000 000 while other regions are poorer, i.e. 1:10 000 000.","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/ds_resolveuid/b2515476c53448d39b499915cd34dde7","","","","",Bio-geographical regions,biodiversity,biota,environment]
