Commission Decision 2004/461/EC provides a questionnaire to be used by the Member States for the annual reporting under the Framework Directive and the related four Daughter Directives 1999/30/EC, 2000/69/EC, 2002/3/EC and 2004/107/EC. Member States have to divide their entire territory into zones. Zones can be regarded as the primary territorial units for assessment and management of air quality under the air quality directives. Consequently, unambiguous definition of all zones is needed. Member States have employed different approaches for the definition of their zones. Some Member States have divided their territory into a single set of zones serving all pollutants. Other Member States have defined a single base set of zones and modified some of the zones for the application to particular pollutants. Where a Member State has distinguished different sets of zones in relation to health protection and ecosystem/vegetation protection respectively, a single location can be situated in several zones, e.g. in a zone defined for all pollutants except lead and in another, larger zone defined for lead.   More information about EU air quality standards is available on the DG Environment web site at http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/quality/standards.htm.   Pursuant to Article 22 of Directive 2008/50/EC, Member States may notify to the Commission when in their opinion the conditions are met in a given zone or agglomeration for postponing the attainment deadline for the limit values for nitrogen dioxide and benzene, or for being exempt from the limit values for PM10.

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.eu.","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered . Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052.

The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country).

Note: Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology, but has no impact for dataset contents and can be dissolved for data extracts. Changes: Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered . Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052.

The Urban Audit (UA) provides European urban statistics for a representative sample of large and medium-sized cities across 30 European countries. It enables an assessment of the state of individual EU cities and provides access to comparative information from other EU cities. This spatial dataset will support the study and dissemination of the UA data. It allows the visualisation of participating cities at three conceptual levels: - UA City - the core city, using an administrative definition - UA City Kernel - a concept introduced to improve comparability between large cities - Larger Urban Zone (LUZ) - approximating the functional urban region In addition, this spatial dataset allows visualisation of a 285 participating cities at two hierarchical sublevels to analyse the disparities within cities: - Sub City Districts level 1 (SCD L1) - Sub City Districts level 2 (SCD L2) The extent of this dataset is the EU-27 plus Croatia (HR), Norway (NO) and Switzerland (CH). The URAU_2004 dataset contains a polygonal feature class for UA Cities, UA City Kernels and Large Urban Zones, derived from the geometry of the GISCO COMM_2004 dataset (based on EuroBoundary Map 2004). Polygonal feature classes for Sub City Districts are derived from the geometry of the GISCO COMM_2004 dataset (based on EuroBoundary Map 2004) or spatial data supplied by URAU delegates which has been made coincident with UA City geometry. A generalised version of each feature class allows for visualisation at the scale of 1:3 Million. UA Cities are also represented by a point topology that are derived from and synchronised with the GISCO STTL_V3 dataset of European Settlements. The UA city points are, when possible, synchronised to an Urban Fabric class in Corine Land Cover 2000.","The third Urban Audit exercise was launched in 2006. The collected data is referenced to 2004. It is managed by the Directorate General for Regional Policy in collaboration with EUROSTAT. The URAU_2004 polygonal geometry for UA Cities, UA City Kernels and Large Urban Zones was derived from the GISCO Communes 2004 regional feature class. Information assigning membership of each EBM 2004 commune to each of the 3 UA conceptual levels was provided at the Country level. The URAU_2004 polygonal geometry for Sub City Districts was either derived from the GISCO Communes 2004 regional feature class (where information assigning membership of each EBM 2004 commune to hierarchical sublevels levels was provided at the Country level), or derived from geometry supplied by URAU delegates which was made coincident with UA City geometry. Generalised versions were created for display at a scale of 1:3 Million. The point geometry of the Urban Audit Cities was based on the GISCO STTL_V3 dataset of European Settlements. Points were created in 17 cases where a UA City could not be matched to a Settlement in GISCO STTL_V3 dataset.   Creation of City, Kernel and LUZ feature classes: Country files listing UA status (City, Kernel and LUZ codes) of each EBM 2004 commune were joined to the geometry of the GISCO COMM_2004 regions. This was dissolved by each UA code to give the multipart regions for each UA level. Attributes were appended to each feature class by joining pre-prepared attribute tables. Creation of UA SCD2 feature classes based on communes 2004 geometry: For countries IE, MT and PT, country files listing the SCD L2 status of each EBM 2004 commune were joined to the geometry of the GISCO COMM_2004 regions. This was dissolved by each SCD L2 code to give multipart regions. Further subdivision of SCD L2 regions in the country of PT were made based on URAU_2001 geometry. Creation of UA SCD2 feature classes based on provided digital maps: For the remaining UA Cities for which SCD geometry is available, SCD L2 regions were derived from GIS files supplied by URAU delegates in various projections, coordinate systems and GIS formats. The SCD L2 regions were converted, projected and had geographic transformations applied where necessary. Some SCD L2 geometry had small manual shifts applied where the exact geographic transformation could not be defined. In the country RO, the outer SCD2 regions are not coincident with GISCO COMM_2004, and were fitted using aerial imagery. The outer SCD L2 boundaries were made coincident with UA City geometry. In the country BE, some internal boundaries were also made coincident with GISCO COMM_2004 geometry. Creation of UA SCD1: SCD attributes were appended to the SCD L2 feature class by joining pre-prepared attribute tables. SCD L1 geometry was created by dissolving SCD L2 boundaries using attributes in the supplied tables. Generalisation of polygonal feature classes to 1:3 million scale: The five polygonal feature classes were generalised for display at a scale of 1:3 Million. The geometries were combined prior to generalisation using a Union, so that boundaries shared between feature classes would also share the same simplified form. Polygons below 2.25km2 were eliminated by merging into the neighbouring polygon sharing the longest border, or deleted (for small islands). At least one feature was retained for each unique City, SCD L1, SCD L2, Kernel and LUZ. The simplification used the Bend Simplify option of the Simplify Polygon tool in ArcGIS 9.3, with a reference baseline of 1500m. Synchronisation of city points with STTL_V3: UA City points were derived by matching City regions to the GISCO Settlement Version 3 dataset (STTL_V3) based on proximity and name-matches. All except 17 UA Cities were matched, and STTL_V3 codes were retained as a UA City attribute. In several cases the STTL_V3 and UA City points were located outside the UA City regions (original or generalised). They were moved so that the point falls inside the RG, while still respecting the requirements for STTL_V3 points. Attribution of COMM_2004: The Urban Audit status of each commune was recorded by appending the City, Kernel and LUZ codes to the COMM_2004_AT attribute table.","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:4258","","","","","","","",Area management/restriction/regulation zones and reporting units,environment,geoscientificInformation]

It is an ecological network of protected areas, set up to ensure the survival of Europe's most valuable species and habitats. Natura 2000 is based on the 1979 Bird's Directive and the 1992 Habitat's Directive. The green infrastructure it provides safeguards numerous ecosystem services and ensures that Europe's natural systems remain healthy and resilient. Natura 2000 is an ecological network composed of sites designated under the Birds Directive (Special Protection Areas, SPAs) and the Habitats Directive (Sites of Community Importance, SCIs, and Special Areas of Conservation, SACs). For each Natura 2000 site, national authorities have submitted a standard data form (SDF) that contains an extensive description of the site and its ecology. The European Topic Centre for Biological Diversity (ETC/BD), based in Paris, is responsible for validating this data and creating an EU wide descriptive database. The European database on Natura 2000 sites consists of data submitted by Member States to the European Commission. This data is subject
to a regular validation and updating process. After validation a new EU-wide Natura 2000 database is released. The date of release of a new EU-wide database does not guarantee that the data has been regularly and uniformly updated by Member States. The spatial data (borders of sites) submitted by each Member State is validated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and linked to the descriptive data.

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

The EEA coastline is a product derived from two sources: EUHYDRO [link not available - yet] and GSHHG [http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhg/]  A priority defined in the input data, first EUHYDRO geometry and, as auxiliary data, GSHHG dataset. The EUHYDRO do not cover the requirement for EEA coastline. The EUHYDRO gaps are in Iceland, Canarias, Madeira, Azores, small islands (not represented in EUDEM) and the northern of Black Sea. The creation process was focused on generating the coastline as line dataset and, later, as a secondary product, defining the polygon layer sea-land. The fundamental step into the workflow was the selection of sea features using a water mask polygon (value in EUHYDRO datasets = 255). The inland water bodies (freshwaters) are rejected by this criteria, except the water bodies connected, at least by one point, to the sea (it is the cases of some transitional water bodies). A few manual amendments to the dataset were necessary to meet requirements from EU Nature Directives, Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive.   This dataset consists of one single line for the whole coastline.","Dissolve:  in order to create a coastline of one single line, first a field is added to the parent dataset (coastline raw), and the same value is set for all the features; the feature class is then dissolved using that field","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/ds_resolveuid/f23e3a3a43344a088c5d76e2876a5f82","","","","",Elevation,coast,Europe,oceans,elevation]

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized.

The 7-day minimum flow period eliminates the day-to-day variations in river flow. It is obtained by moving an averaging window with an interval of 7 days over the discharge time series. For each year, the minimum was extracted from the smoothed discharge time series, resulting in a sample of 30 yearly minima for each period. To estimate the probability of extreme low river flows a Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution (Coles, 2001; Katz et al., 2002) was fitted to the annual minimum values in every river cell using Maximum Likelihood estimation. More details on the methodology can be found in Feyen and Dankers (2009).The indicators for evaluating vulnerability to droughts are based on the hydrological simulations and statistical analysis provided by JRC (Annex 3). Here, river discharges calculated by LISFLOOD are reduced by water consumption, which were computed with WaterGAP.

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.europa.eu/","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered . Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country). National data, when transformed into the common European reference, are introduced into tiled pan-European structure and as final step seamless dataset is produced. In order to achieve production of the real seamless European database, the integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. It consists from edge-matching of land cover polygons from the national databases across national borders done by a verification / re-interpretation of the satellite images in the border regions (2 km wide strip along borders). The satellite images from IMAGE2000. CLC90, CHA00 (changes 1990-2000) and CLC00 database were harmonized this way, but the order to priority was as following: CLC2000, both geometric and thematic adaptations of all polygons in a 2 km strip along national boundary lines; CHA00 database to ensure that changes in CLC2000 are consistent with the change database; corrected CLC90 (if provided by the MS); corrections were focused to geometric adaptations in semi-automatical way based on CLC00 and CHA00 databases. Border harmonization step has been skipped for CHA06 and CLC06 datasets.

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether.

All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized. The resolution of the data is 100 x 100 and 250 x 250 metres (change grids 100 x 100 metres).CHANGES:Version 13 (02/2010) Production date: February 16th, 2010 This is the 13th CLC grid update and 5nd version containing also data from CLC2006 update (36 countries - only UK, CH and GR data still missing from complete CLC2006 coverage).

The EU-DEM is a 3D raster dataset with elevations captured at 1 arc second postings (2.78E-4 degrees) or about every 30 meter. It is a hybrid product based on SRTM and ASTER GDEM data fused by a weighted averaging approach. The EU-DEM is generated as a contiguous dataset devided into 1 degree by 1 degree tiles corresponding to the SRTM naming convention. Ownership of EU-DEM belongs to European Commision, DG Enterprise and Industry.","The EU-DEM data product is derived from an automated data fusion process using SRTM and ASTER GDEM digital surface model (DSM) data. Intermap's NEXTMap Europe dataset is utilized to remove any consistent horizontal bias in the GDEM data. The EU-DEM product is edited to ensure that water features are adequately represented and consistent with the hydrography layer provided by Aerogeodezijos Institutas (AGI) in Kaunas, Lithuania. Residual clouds within the GDEM data are identified and removed same as suspect data extremely differing from the SRTM data. All EU-DEM tiles are edited interactively in a 3D stereo environment. The editing is restricted to the hydrographic features and pits and bumps. In areas above 60 degress North, the EU-DEM generation process is supported by other DEM data sources provided by JRC. Water features are flattened (oceans, lakes) and stepped (rivers) based on the hydrography data produced by AGI.

The GAUL aims at compiling and disseminating the most reliable spatial information on administrative units for all the countries in the world, providing a contribution to the standardization of the spatial dataset representing administrative units. The GAUL always maintains global layers with a unified coding system at country, first (e.g. regions) and second administrative levels (e.g. districts). In addition, when data is available, it provides layers on a country by country basis down to third, fourth and lowers levels.   The GAUL is released once a year and the target beneficiary of the GAUL data is the UN community, the Universities and other authorized international and national institutions/agencies. Data might not be officially validated by authoritative national sources and can not be distributed to the general public. A disclaimer should always accompany any use of the GAUL data. About 21 countries have been updated respect to the previous release (see countries_updated.dbf). The GAUL keeps track of administrative units that has been changed, added or dismissed in the past for political causes. Changes implemented in different years are recorded in the GAUL on different layers. For this reason the GAUL product is not a single layer but a group of layers, named  GAUL Set  (see Gaul_Set.pdf).   The original dataset containing Level 0 administrative units has been combined by EEA with some attributes data provided within GAUL in a separate file. No data from outside GAUL have been used and it is possible to reconstruct the original dataset by removing the extra attributes added.","The overall methodology consists in 				  a) collecting the best available data from most reliable sources, 				  b) establishing validation periods of the geographic features (when possible), 				  c) adding selected data to the global layer based on the last country boundaries map provided by the UN Cartographic Unit (UNCS), 				  d) generating codes using the GAUL Coding System and e) distribute data to the users (see GAUL Doc01 Ver17.pdf) Because the GAUL works at global level, controversial boundaries can not be ignored. The approach of the GAUL is to maintain disputed areas in such a way to preserve national integrity for all disputing countries (see GAUL Doc01 Ver17.pdf and disputed_areas.dbf). The coastal line of the GAUL is mostly compliant with the coast of the International Boundary map delivered by UNCS except for some countries (e.g. Viet Nam, India, Bangaldesh, etc.) where it has been updated according to the satellite images (e.g. Landsat ETM). For the next releases of the GAUL, the updating process of the coast-line will go on, country by country, through a comparison with the satellite images.","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:4326","","","","","","","",Administrative units,boundaries]

The accuracy of input input data only allows the designation of salt affected areas with a limited level of reliability (e.g. < 50 or > 50% of the area); therefore the results represented in the map should only be used for orientating purposes. 			 			Two major data sources are available to delineate areas at risk of salt accumulation in Europe: The European Soil Database (ESDB, 2004) and the map of salt affected soils in Europe compiled by Szabolcs (1974). Szabolcs’ map was of pressing importance in the 1970s because the salinity and alkalinity of soils hindered the satisfactory agricultural utilisation of lands in many regions.   To delineate an updated map of salt affected soils in Europe, items from the two databases were selected that have characteristics of salt affected or potentially salt effected soils. Potentially salt affected refers to soils that are at present not or to a very low degree saline or alkaline, but where human intervention (irrigation) may cause their considerable salinisation and/or alkanisation/sodification (Szabolcs, 1974).   The information on salinity and alkalinity, available directly or through pedotransfer rules in the ESDB, is described in detail by Baruth et al. (2006). In the WRB (World Reference Base) soil names that give information about salinity are Solonchaks,  salic  soils, or  petrosalic  soils.
