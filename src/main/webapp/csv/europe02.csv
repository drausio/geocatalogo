The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.eu.","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered . Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country). National data, when transformed into the common European reference, are introduced into tiled pan-European structure and as final step seamless dataset is produced. In order to achieve production of the real seamless European database, the integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. It consists from edge-matching of land cover polygons from the national databases across national borders done by a verification / re-interpretation of the satellite images in the border regions (2 km wide strip along borders). The satellite images from IMAGE2000. CLC90, CHA00 and CLC00 database were harmonized this way, but the order to priority was as following: CLC2000, both geometric and thematic adaptations of all polygons in a 2 km strip along national boundary lines; CHA00 database to ensure that changes in CLC2000 are consistent with the change database; corrected CLC90 (if provided by the MS); corrections were focused to geometric adaptations in semi-automatical way based on CLC00 and CHA00 databases. Border harmonization step has been skipped for CHA06 and CLC06 datasets. Note: Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology, but has no impact for dataset contents and can be dissolved for data extracts.

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services.

It is the resulting product of a collaborative project involving all the European Union and neighbouring countries. It is a simplified representation of the diversity and spatial variability of the soil coverage. The methodology used to differentiate and name the main soil types is based on the terminology of the F.A.O. legend for the Soil Map of the World at Scale 1:5,000,000. This terminology has been refined and adapted to take account of the specificities of the landscapes in Europa. It is itself founded on the distinction of the main pedogenetic processes leading to soil differentiation: brunification, lessivage, podzolisation, hydromorphy, etc.  The database contains a list of Soil Typological Units (STU). Besides the soil names they represent, these units are described by variables (attributes) specifying the nature and properties of the soils: for example the texture, the water regime, the stoniness, etc. The geographical representation was chosen at a scale corresponding to the 1:1,000,000. At this scale, it is not feasible to delineate the STUs. Therefore they are grouped into Soil Mapping Units (SMU) to form soil associations and to illustrate the functioning of pedological systems within the landscapes.  Harmonisation of the soil data from the member countries is based on a dictionary giving the definition for each occurrence of the variables. Considering the scale, the precision of the variables is weak. Furthermore these variables were estimated over large areas by expert judgement rather than measured on local soil samples. This expertise results from synthesis and generalisation tasks of national or regional maps published at more detailed scales, for example 1:50,000 or 1:25,000 scales. Delineation of the Soil Mapping Units is also the result of expertise and experience. Heterogeneity can be considerable in European regions. The spatial variability of soils is very important and is difficult to express at global levels of precision. Quality indices of the information (purity and confidence level) are included with the data in order to guide usage.  This metadata record is adapted from the orginal one received from JRC.","Refer to http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ESDB_Archive/ESDBv2/fr_intro.htm","urn:ogc:def:crs:European Environment Agency::urn:ogc:def:crs:EEA:1.0:777101","","","http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/library/esdac/Esdac_DetailData2.cfm?id=1","","","","",Soil,Soil,geoscientificInformation]

This layer contains UMZ delineations for Europe, based on Corine Land Cover database. During 2012, the UMZ methodology was updated in order to correct errors derived for the water course as join elements between urban areas. Previous version applied over CLC v15 (and previous version) joined many small urban areas due to the water presence. This fact was erroneous from the landscape and urban perspective as most of those areas remain as urban-rural typologies. Moreover, water courses cannot be considered as roads from the urban morphological view (either from the commuting point of understanding). This new version, known as v16, corrected this effect in the majority of cases.","An Urban Morphological Zone can be defined as “A set of urban areas laying less than 200m apart”. Those urban areas are defined from land cover classes contributing to the urban tissue and function. The Corine Land Cover classes (Figure 1) used to build the Urban Morphological Zone dataset are the following ones: • Core Classes o 111 – Continuous urban fabric o 112 – Discontinuous urban fabric o 121 – Industrial or commercial units o 141 – Green urban areas • Enlarged core classes, CLC Classes 123 (Port areas), 124 (Airports) and 142 (Sport and leisure facilities), are also considered if they are neighbours to the core classes or to one of them touching the core classes. • Road and rail networks, CLC class 122 when neighbours to the enlarged core classes, roads and rails will be included (cut by 300m buffer) as part of the UMZ due to their artificial nature and connectivity properties. • Water courses, CLC class 511, when neighbours to the enlarged core classes and acting as a link between them, they are selected by this fact. • Forests & scrub, CLC classes 311,312,313,322,323,324, when they are completely within the core classes.

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

The GAUL aims at compiling and disseminating the most reliable spatial information on administrative units for all the countries in the world, providing a contribution to the standardization of the spatial dataset representing administrative units. The GAUL always maintains global layers with a unified coding system at country, first (e.g. regions) and second administrative levels (e.g. districts). In addition, when data is available, it provides layers on a country by country basis down to third, fourth and lowers levels.  The GAUL is released once a year and the target beneficiary of the GAUL data is the UN community, the Universities and other authorized international and national institutions/agencies. Data might not be officially validated by authoritative national sources and can not be distributed to the general public. A disclaimer should always accompany any use of the GAUL data. About 21 countries have been updated respect to the previous release (see countries_updated.dbf). The GAUL keeps track of administrative units that has been changed, added or dismissed in the past for political causes. Changes implemented in different years are recorded in the GAUL on different layers. For this reason the GAUL product is not a single layer but a group of layers, named  GAUL Set  (see Gaul_Set.pdf).  The original dataset containing Level 0 administrative units has been combined by EEA with some attributes data provided within GAUL in a separate file. No data from outside GAUL have been used and it is possible to reconstruct the original dataset by removing the extra attributes added.","The overall methodology consists in 				  a) collecting the best available data from most reliable sources, 				  b) establishing validation periods of the geographic features (when possible), 				  c) adding selected data to the global layer based on the last country boundaries map provided by the UN Cartographic Unit (UNCS), 				  d) generating codes using the GAUL Coding System and e) distribute data to the users (see GAUL Doc01 Ver17.pdf) Because the GAUL works at global level, controversial boundaries can not be ignored. The approach of the GAUL is to maintain disputed areas in such a way to preserve national integrity for all disputing countries (see GAUL Doc01 Ver17.pdf and disputed_areas.dbf). The coastal line of the GAUL is mostly compliant with the coast of the International Boundary map delivered by UNCS except for some countries (e.g. Viet Nam, India, Bangaldesh, etc.) where it has been updated according to the satellite images (e.g. Landsat ETM). For the next releases of the GAUL, the updating process of the coast-line will go on, country by country, through a comparison with the satellite images.","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:4326","","","","","","","",Administrative units,boundaries]

Irrigation consumption refers to the part of the irrigation water that is really “consumed” by the crops and evapotranspirates (net irrigation requirements).The amount of water used for irrigation has been calculated for the base year based on the baseline climate (1961-90). It must be noted that the future irrigation water requirements were calculated within SCENES, i.e. the climate change input differs from the climate data used in the ClimWatAdapt framework because another emission scenario and different GCM output were applied. The assessment is performed on the river basin level for average annual conditions as well as for the summer season (JJA). This indicator does not consider the reduction of natural flow by upstream consumptive use, thus the water resources are only available for irrigation.By using this indicator, it is assumed that a drainage basin suffers from severe water stress if c.t.a. > 0.3 or, in other words, if irrigation consumption exceeds 40% of reliable annual (or seasonal) water availability. A c.t.a. below 0.3 indicates low to mid water stress. The thresholds are chosen arbitrarily but have been derived from EEA (2003) which shows a figure for the water consumption index ranging from (almost) zero to 30% in Europe. According to EEA (2003), the average water consumption index in Europe is 3%.","The annual water consumption for irrigation is modelled by WaterGAP. The water consumption for irrigation during June, July and August is calculated by dividing the annual water consumption for irrigation by 4. The water availability during June, July and August is modelled by LISFLOOD.","urn:ogc:def:crs:::EPSG:4258","","","","","","","OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map",water management,agriculture,irrigation,ClimWatAdapt,water,Atmospheric conditions,climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere]

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data, with Natural Earth one can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software. Natural Earth was built through a collaboration of many volunteers and is supported by NACIS (North American Cartographic Information Society), and is free for use in any type of project. This dataset is composed of satellite-derived land cover data and shaded relief presented with a light, natural palette suitable for making thematic and reference maps.","Extracted from http://www.shadedrelief.com/natural/pages/indepth.html 				  Part 2: Data sources   a) Landcover - Natural Earth landcover derives primarily from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF), a 500-meter resolution product of the University Maryland, Global Land Cover Facility. NASA's Terra satellite collects the raw data from which MODIS VCF derives.  MODIS VCF is comprised of three data channels, forest, herbaceous, and bare. Assigning flat colors (dark green for forest, light green for herbaceous, and gray for bare) to these channels, which blend into one another, creates an image of Earth that appears natural. To give the bare channel more visual interest (i.e. tonal modulation), a lightened and recolorized version of NASA's Blue Marble image substitutes for flat gray in desert and highland areas, which appear reddish-brown and gray-blue respectively.  For a full discussion of natural-color mapping techniques refer to this article [http://www.shadedrelief.com/shelton/].  Other data used in Natural Earth include:  b) Shaded relief - Downsampled SRTM30 with void-filling enhancements by Natural Graphics, except for Antarctica which derives from GTOPO30.  c) Bathymetry - ETOPO2 obtained from NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center website. Note: only the downsampled (10,800 x 5,400) version of Natural Earth uses bathymetry.  d) Glaciers and Antarctic ice shelves - Digital Chart of the World (DCW) 1:1,000,000-scale vector data originally developed by the US National Geospatial Agency (formerly DMA and, more recently, NIMA). Antarctic ice tones derive from Blue Marble. Greenland ice tones are blue-tinted shaded relief.  e) Arctic pack ice - Digitized from the CIA's Polar Regions Atlas, 1978, page 12. The stylized ice boundary depicts estimated absolute minimum sea ice extent, a theoretical concept rather than an observable geographic location. Use the pack ice overlay only for small-scale and generalized map presentations.  f) Seas, lakes, and rivers - Extracted from MODIS VCF. The eastern one-third of Iceland, arctic areas north of 80 degrees, all of Antarctica, and many mid-ocean islands are not included in the dataset. The water boundary accompanying GTOPO30 elevation data substitutes in the areas not covered by MODIS VCF.  g) International boundaries - ESRI Shapefile provided by the Office of the Geographer, US Department of State. Boundary representation is not necessarily authoritative.  h) AVHRR urban - Extracted from 1-kilometer resolution Global Land Cover Characteristics Data Base Version 2.0 distributed by the USGS.  i) MODIS urban - Extracted from 1-kilometer resolution Binary MOD12Q1 data (a MODIS-based product) obtained from Boston University, Department of Geography.   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++	 		 	  Part 3: Data issues   Of the nearly 525 million pixels that comprise Natural Earth, not all are perfect. Although created from satellite data, Natural Earth is a derivative graphical product that includes manual touchups. Use it accordingly.  The following are potential areas of concern for users.  a) Incomplete MODIS VCF landcover coverage - The eastern one-third of Iceland, arctic areas north of 80 degrees, all of Antarctica, and numerous ocean islands including Hawaii, Vanua Levu (Fiji), and the Shetland and Faroe Islands are missing from the data set.  b) Filling the voids in MODIS VCF landcover involved several methods. Polar areas where little vegetation grows were the easiest to manage. Working backward from water and glacier coverages obtained from other sources, all unglaciated terrestrial areas received a bare classification and gray coloration. For eastern Iceland, where measurable vegetation exists, Binary MOD12Q1 landcover substituted for the missing MODIS VCF to show the herbaceous tundra as a pale green tint.  c) Coloring small oceanic islands (most are only a few pixels wide) involved cloning landcover colors from nearby land areas with similar climate and vegetation characteristics. Manual painting in Photoshop using printed vegetation maps as a guide further enhanced the larger Hawaiian Islands.  d) Discolored pixels - Pixels with unexpected colors (typically red-brown and gray) fringe some ocean shorelines and interior water bodies that fluctuate in size, a by-product of merging MODIS VCF and Blue Marble datasets. Filtering and manual cloning with the Clone Tool (rubber stamp) in Photoshop eliminated most of the discoloration.  e) Snow removal - Another unwanted by-product of merged MODIS VCF and Blue Marble data was the appearance of patchy snow in the southern Andes and adjacent Patagonia between 35 and 45 degrees south latitude. Natural Earth depicts glaciers but not temporary snow cover. Sampling landcover colors from adjacent areas free of snow and painting in Photoshop removed the snow. The dramatic shaded relief of the Andes largely obscures this fix.  f) Ghosted shaded relief - The Blue Marble image contains embedded shaded relief. In desert and highland areas on Natural Earth, a faint impression of the shaded relief is visible where recolorized and lightened Blue Marble contributes to the landcover.  g) Polar areas - Reflecting the accuracy of the global datasets from which it derives, the resolution and general quality of data in polar regions on Natural Earth is less than that of other areas of the world.  h) Water - Only the largest rivers appear on the water layer provided with Natural Earth, discontinuously.

Irrigation consumption refers to the part of the irrigation water that is really “consumed” by the crops and evapotranspirates (net irrigation requirements).The amount of water used for irrigation has been calculated for the base year based on the baseline climate (1961-90). It must be noted that the future irrigation water requirements were calculated within SCENES, i.e. the climate change input differs from the climate data used in the ClimWatAdapt framework because another emission scenario and different GCM output were applied. The assessment is performed on the river basin level for average annual conditions as well as for the summer season (JJA). This indicator does not consider the reduction of natural flow by upstream consumptive use, thus the water resources are only available for irrigation.By using this indicator, it is assumed that a drainage basin suffers from severe water stress if c.t.a. > 0.3 or, in other words, if irrigation consumption exceeds 40% of reliable annual (or seasonal) water availability. A c.t.a. below 0.3 indicates low to mid water stress. The thresholds are chosen arbitrarily but have been derived from EEA (2003) which shows a figure for the water consumption index ranging from (almost) zero to 30% in Europe. According to EEA (2003), the average water consumption index in Europe is 3%.","The annual water consumption for irrigation is modelled by WaterGAP. The water consumption for irrigation during June, July and August is calculated by dividing the annual water consumption for irrigation by 4. The water availability during June, July and August is modelled by LISFLOOD.","urn:ogc:def:crs:::EPSG:4258","","","","","","","OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map",water management,water stress,WEI,ClimWatAdapt,water,Atmospheric conditions,climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere]

With the help of CLC data it is possible to provide support for protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive. CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services.

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.europa.eu/","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered . Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country). National data, when transformed into the common European reference, are introduced into tiled pan-European structure and as final step seamless dataset is produced. In order to achieve production of the real seamless European database, the integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. It consists from edge-matching of land cover polygons from the national databases across national borders done by a verification / re-interpretation of the satellite images in the border regions (2 km wide strip along borders). The satellite images from IMAGE2000.

Border harmonization step has been skipped for CHA06 and CLC06 datasets.

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized. The resolution of the data is 100 x 100 and 250 x 250 metres (change grids 100 x 100 metres).","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/ds_resolveuid/b00116e51c79865cf89a84162b8fd21e","","","","",Land cover,environment,geoscientificInformation]

Fifty-four (54) auxiliary variables in the form of raster maps at 1km resolution were used to explain the differences in the distribution of soil pHCaCl2 and the kriged map of the residuals from the regression model was added. The goodness of fit of the regression model was satisfactory (R2adj = 0.43) and its residuals follow a Gaussian distribution. The lowest values correspond to the soils developed on acid rock (granites, quartzite’s, sandstones, etc), while the higher values are related to the presence of calcareous sediments and basic rocks. The validation of the model shows that the model is quite accurate (R2adj = 0.56). This shows the validity of Regression-Kriging in the estimation of the distribution of soil properties when a large and adequately documented number of soil measurements are available.

Commission Decision 2004/461/EC provides a questionnaire to be used by the Member States for the annual reporting under the Framework Directive and the related four Daughter Directives 1999/30/EC, 2000/69/EC, 2002/3/EC and 2004/107/EC. Member States have to divide their entire territory into zones. Zones can be regarded as the primary territorial units for assessment and management of air quality under the air quality directives. Consequently, unambiguous definition of all zones is needed. Member States have employed different approaches for the definition of their zones. Some Member States have divided their territory into a single set of zones serving all pollutants. Other Member States have defined a single base set of zones and modified some of the zones for the application to particular pollutants. Where a Member State has distinguished different sets of zones in relation to health protection and ecosystem/vegetation protection respectively, a single location can be situated in several zones, e.g. in a zone defined for all pollutants except lead and in another, larger zone defined for lead.  More information about EU air quality standards is available on the DG Environment web site at http://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/quality/standards.htm.

One of the most important indicators for water scarcity or water stress is the water exploitation index (WEI) or water stress indicator (w.t.a.), which is defined as the total water withdrawals-to-water availability ratio within a river basin. Water scarcity can be the result of intensive water use, low water availability (climate driven) or a combination of these pressures. The indicator provides to policy makers a quick overview of areas that may encounter water shortage problems. WEI or a w.t.a.-value between 0.0 and 0.2 is considered a low water stress, WEI between 0.2 and 0.4medium water stress, and a value greater than 0.4 severe water stress. This variant of the water exploitation index is defined as the ratio of water withdrawals in all sectors to water availability. Annual WEI is calculated on a river basin level for the baseline and the 2050s. Here, baseline conditions are defined as water availability averaged over the climate normal period 1961-90 and water withdrawals for the year 2005. For the 2050s, water availability is averaged over the period 2041-2070 (2050s) and calculated as the median of the hydrological simulations. Total water withdrawals are represented by two different socio-economic scenarios, the SCENES scenarios “Economy First” (EcF) and “Sustainability Eventually” (SuE).","The water withdrawals are calculated by WaterGAP, and results for the SCENES scenarios “Economy First” (EcF) and “Sustainability Eventually” (SuE) are selected (Annex 3). Water availability is computed as the median of an ensemble of LISFLOOD simulations driven by climate projections of 11 different GCM-RCM combinations (see Annex 3, Table 1) for the period 2041-2070 (representing 2050s). The climate projections are taken from the ENSEMBLES project and are based on the SRES A1B scenario (Annex 3).","urn:ogc:def:crs:::EPSG:4258","","","","","","","OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map",water management,water stress,WEI,ClimWatAdapt,water,Atmospheric conditions,climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere]

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Input data: Corine Land Cover 1990 - 2000 changes (file geodatabase v10)  Rasterisation using gdal_rasterize from GDAL 1.9.0 command line utilities - Loop through the list of layers, and generate the layers as defined there, see the shell script [0] and the list of layers (layer_code.list) [1].  - Thereby translating the 3-digit CLC codes (111...999) into grid codes within the 8-bit  range (0...44), see clc_legend.csv [2] - And eventually adding the usual CLC colour table to the generated GeoTIFF, by using a pre-defined vrt file, see [3]  [0]: docs/rasterize.sh [1]: docs/layer_code.list [2]: docs/clc_legend.csv [3]: docs/legend_100.vrt","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/ds_resolveuid/7aa9fb3c-406a-49fc-920a-d9c9a53bd241","","","","",Land cover,environment,geoscientificInformation]

The National Mapping Agencies of each of the participating countries are responsible for the map elements of the areas of their respective countries. Process steps: Each data supplier has converted its analogue and digital data into the EuroGlobalMap specifications observing the EGM Technical guidelines. Details about these processes and country specific extraction peculiarities can be found in the national lineage sections. Subregional and Regional Coordinators performed thorough interactive and automatic quality checking on the delivered data. Subsequently the coordinators compiled the national contributions into a seamless harmonized dataset, referring to international boundaries with common geometry agreed by all partners. The harmonisation process followed the rules laid down in the EGM Specifications and Technical Guidelines.

It is an ecological network of protected areas, set up to ensure the survival of Europe's most valuable species and habitats. Natura 2000 is based on the 1979 Bird's Directive and the 1992 Habitat's Directive. The green infrastructure it provides safeguards numerous ecosystem services and ensures that Europe's natural systems remain healthy and resilient. Natura 2000 is an ecological network composed of sites designated under the Birds Directive (Special Protection Areas, SPAs) and the Habitats Directive (Sites of Community Importance, SCIs, and Special Areas of Conservation, SACs). For each Natura 2000 site, national authorities have submitted a standard data form (SDF) that contains an extensive description of the site and its ecology. The European Topic Centre for Biological Diversity (ETC/BD), based in Paris, is responsible for validating this data and creating an EU wide descriptive database. The European database on Natura 2000 sites consists of data submitted by Member States to the European Commission. This data is subject
to a regular validation and updating process. After validation a new EU-wide Natura 2000 database is released. The date of release of a new EU-wide database does not guarantee that the data has been regularly and uniformly updated by Member States. The spatial data (borders of sites) submitted by each Member State is validated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and linked to the descriptive data. Any problems identified during this process are brought to the attention of the concerned Member States. There are specific terms and conditions relating to the use of downloaded boundary data within the United Kingdom. If you intend to use the UK data you must first agree to the end user licence http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-5232. Please note that some Member States have submitted sensitive information that has been filtered out of this database. The following Member States have submitted sensitive information: Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Sweden and United Kingdom. This concerns mainly species associated to specific sites. All reference to these species has been removed from the related sites. If this sensitive information is necessary to your field of research, please contact the Member States' administrations individually. You can find a compiled list of national or regional Natura 2000 websites at the following address: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/natura2000/db_gis/index_en.htm#sites","Member States update Natura 2000 spatial data continuously.

Irrigation consumption refers to the part of the irrigation water that is really “consumed” by the crops and evapotranspirates (net irrigation requirements).The amount of water used for irrigation has been calculated for the base year based on the baseline climate (1961-90). It must be noted that the future irrigation water requirements were calculated within SCENES, i.e. the climate change input differs from the climate data used in the ClimWatAdapt framework because another emission scenario and different GCM output were applied. The assessment is performed on the river basin level for average annual conditions as well as for the summer season (JJA). This indicator does not consider the reduction of natural flow by upstream consumptive use, thus the water resources are only available for irrigation.By using this indicator, it is assumed that a drainage basin suffers from severe water stress if c.t.a. > 0.3 or, in other words, if irrigation consumption exceeds 40% of reliable annual (or seasonal) water availability. A c.t.a. below 0.3 indicates low to mid water stress. The thresholds are chosen arbitrarily but have been derived from EEA (2003) which shows a figure for the water consumption index ranging from (almost) zero to 30% in Europe. According to EEA (2003), the average water consumption index in Europe is 3%.","The annual water consumption for irrigation is modelled by WaterGAP. The water consumption for irrigation during June, July and August is calculated by dividing the annual water consumption for irrigation by 4. The water availability during June, July and August is modelled by LISFLOOD.","urn:ogc:def:crs:::EPSG:4258","","","","","","","OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map",water management,agriculture,irrigation,ClimWatAdapt,water,Atmospheric conditions,climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere]

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.eu","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized. The resolution of the data is 100 x 100 and 250 x 250 metres (change grids 100 x 100 metres).","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","","","","","",Land cover,environment,geoscientificInformation]

The dbf tables of the shape files include the columns “EU_CD_GW” as the GWB identifier and “Horizon” describing the vertical positioning. The polygon identifier “Polygon_ID” was added subsequently, because some GWBs consist of several polygons with identical “EU_CD_GW”even in the same horizon. Some further GWB characteristics are provided with the Microsoft Excel file “GWB_attributes_2012June.xls” including the column “EU_CD_GW”, which serves as a key for joining spatial and attribute data. There is no corresponding spatial data for GWBs in the Microsoft Excel table without an entry in column “EU_CD_GW”.  The spatial resolution is given for about a half of the GWBs in the column “Scale” of the xls file, which is varying between the MS from 1:10,000 to 1:1,000,000 and mostly in the range from 1:50,000 to 1:250,000.","All GWBs assigned to horizon 1 are collected in the shape GWB_horizon_h1 regardless the structure of the shape files submitted by the MS with affiliation to horizons, River Basin Districts or both.

The evaluation of the soil’s natural susceptibility is based on the creation of logical connections between relevant parameters (pedotransfer rules). The input parameters for these pedotransfer rules are taken from the attributes of the European soil database, e.g. soil properties: type, texture and water regime, depth to textural change and the limitation of the soil for agricultural use. Besides the main parameters auxiliary parameters have been used as impermeable layer, depth of an obstacle to roots, water management system, dominant and secondary land use. It was assumed that every soil, as a porous medium, could be compacted.  The map of natural soil susceptibility to compaction was created from the evaluation of selected parameters from the ESDB. The soil susceptibility to compaction was divided into 4 categories. Two additional categories represent the data concerning places where this evaluation was either not relevant or could not been provided because of lack of information. In total there are 6 categories (attribute  Evaluation  in the shapefile):      0 - no soil.

Median  of ensemble flood results as calculated by LISFLOOD.One of the most frequently used indicators for large floods is the discharge of a 100-year flood, defined as a flood that statistically returns once in 100 years. 100-year floods are extreme flood events, causing especially high economical damage. Therefore, the public interest is high in information about future changes in the magnitude of 100-year floods or in the frequency of what is currently a 100-year flood. Further, this indicator is frequently used for the dimensioning of flood protection works.","The indicators for evaluating vulnerability to floods are based on the hydrological simulations and statistical analysis provided by JRC (Annex 3). To enhance the robustness and informative value of expected climate change impacts on flood hazards in Europe, this study aims at providing an assessment based on an ensemble of hydrological model results calculated by LISFLOOD. Here, the model was forced by 11 GCMRCM climate projections representing the SRES A1B emissions scenario. Then the 100-years flood indicator for large flood events is calculated: For each year, the maximum discharge is selected from the discharge time series. This results in a set of 30 maximum values for each time period, through which a Gumbel distribution is fitted using Maximum Likelihood estimation. Based on the fitted Gumbel distribution flood discharges are derived for the 100-year return interval and future recurrence intervals are derived of a current 100-year flood. More details on the methodology can be found in Dankers and Feyen (2008, 2009). The ensemble median builds the basis for the hydrological information.","urn:ogc:def:crs:::EPSG:4258","","","","","","","OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map",water management,floods,ClimWatAdapt,water,Atmospheric conditions,climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere]

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.eu.","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered . Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country). National data, when transformed into the common European reference, are introduced into tiled pan-European structure and as final step seamless dataset is produced. In order to achieve production of the real seamless European database, the integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. It consists from edge-matching of land cover polygons from the national databases across national borders done by a verification / re-interpretation of the satellite images in the border regions (2 km wide strip along borders). The satellite images from IMAGE2000. CLC90, CHA00 and CLC00 database were harmonized this way, but the order to priority was as following: CLC2000, both geometric and thematic adaptations of all polygons in a 2 km strip along national boundary lines; CHA00 database to ensure that changes in CLC2000 are consistent with the change database; corrected CLC90 (if provided by the MS); corrections were focused to geometric adaptations in semi-automatical way based on CLC00 and CHA00 databases. Border harmonization step has been skipped for CHA06 and CLC06 datasets. Note: Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology, but has no impact for dataset contents and can be dissolved for data extracts.

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.eu.","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered . Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country). National data, when transformed into the common European reference, are introduced into tiled pan-European structure and as final step seamless dataset is produced. In order to achieve production of the real seamless European database, the integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. It consists from edge-matching of land cover polygons from the national databases across national borders done by a verification / re-interpretation of the satellite images in the border regions (2 km wide strip along borders). The satellite images from IMAGE2000. CLC90, CHA00 and CLC00 database were harmonized this way, but the order to priority was as following: CLC2000, both geometric and thematic adaptations of all polygons in a 2 km strip along national boundary lines; CHA00 database to ensure that changes in CLC2000 are consistent with the change database; corrected CLC90 (if provided by the MS); corrections were focused to geometric adaptations in semi-automatical way based on CLC00 and CHA00 databases. Border harmonization step has been skipped for CHA06 and CLC06 datasets.

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative.

It is an ecological network of protected areas, set up to ensure the survival of Europe's most valuable species and habitats. Natura 2000 is based on the 1979 Bird's Directive and the 1992 Habitat's Directive.  Natura 2000 is an ecological network composed of sites designated under the Birds Directive (Special Protection Areas, SPAs) and the Habitats Directive (Sites of Community Importance, SCIs, and Special Areas of Conservation, SACs).   For each Natura 2000 site, national authorities have submitted a standard data form (SDF) that contains an extensive description of the site and its ecology. The European Topic Centre for Biological Diversity (ETC/BD), based in Paris, is responsible for validating these datasets and for creating an EU wide descriptive database .   The European database on Natura 2000 sites consists of data submitted by Member States to the European Commission. The European database is generally updated once per year, so as to take into account any updating of the content of the national databases by Member States. After validation a new EU-wide Natura 2000 database is released.  However, the release of a new EU-wide database does not provide any guarantee that a particular national dataset has recently been updated.   The spatial data (borders of sites) submitted by each Member State is validated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and linked to the descriptive data. Any problems identified during this process are brought to the attention of the concerned Member States.   There are specific terms and conditions relating to the use of downloaded boundary data within the United Kingdom. If you intend to use the UK data you must first agree to the end user licence http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-5232.   Please note that some Member States have submitted sensitive information that has been filtered out of this database.

Irrigation consumption refers to the part of the irrigation water that is really “consumed” by the crops and evapotranspirates (net irrigation requirements).The amount of water used for irrigation has been calculated for the base year based on the baseline climate (1961-90). It must be noted that the future irrigation water requirements were calculated within SCENES, i.e. the climate change input differs from the climate data used in the ClimWatAdapt framework because another emission scenario and different GCM output were applied. The assessment is performed on the river basin level for average annual conditions as well as for the summer season (JJA). This indicator does not consider the reduction of natural flow by upstream consumptive use, thus the water resources are only available for irrigation.By using this indicator, it is assumed that a drainage basin suffers from severe water stress if c.t.a. > 0.3 or, in other words, if irrigation consumption exceeds 40% of reliable annual (or seasonal) water availability. A c.t.a. below 0.3 indicates low to mid water stress. The thresholds are chosen arbitrarily but have been derived from EEA (2003) which shows a figure for the water consumption index ranging from (almost) zero to 30% in Europe. According to EEA (2003), the average water consumption index in Europe is 3%.","The annual water consumption for irrigation is modelled by WaterGAP. The water consumption for irrigation during June, July and August is calculated by dividing the annual water consumption for irrigation by 4. The water availability during June, July and August is modelled by LISFLOOD.","urn:ogc:def:crs:::EPSG:4258","","","","","","","OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map",water management,water stress,WEI,ClimWatAdapt,water,Atmospheric conditions,climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere]

To enhance the robustness and informative value of expected climate change impacts on flood hazards in Europe, this study aims at providing an assessment based on an ensemble of hydrological model results calculated by LISFLOOD. Here, the model was forced by 11 GCMRCM climate projections representing the SRES A1B emissions scenario. Then the 100-years flood indicator for large flood events is calculated: For each year, the maximum discharge is selected from the discharge time series. This results in a set of 30 maximum values for each time period, through which a Gumbel distribution is fitted using Maximum Likelihood estimation. Based on the fitted Gumbel distribution flood discharges are derived for the 100-year return interval and future recurrence intervals are derived of a current 100-year flood. More details on the methodology can be found in Dankers and Feyen (2008, 2009).

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.europa.eu","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa- Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country). National data, when transformed into the common European reference, are introduced into tiled pan-European structure and as final step seamless dataset is produced. In order to achieve production of the real seamless European database, the integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. It consists from edgematching of land cover polygons from the national databases across national borders done by a verification / re-interpretation of the satellite images in the border regions (2 km wide strip along borders). The satellite images from IMAGE2000. CLC90, CHA00 and CLC00 database were harmonized this way, but the order to priority was as following: CLC2000, both geometric and thematic adaptations of all polygons in a 2 km strip along national boundary lines; CHA00 database to ensure that changes in CLC2000 are consistent with the change database; corrected CLC90 (if provided by the MS); corrections were focused to geometric adaptations in semi-automatical way based on CLC00 and CHA00 databases. Border harmonization step has been skipped for CHA06 dataset and for CLC00 revised dataset. Simplified border harmonization step for CLC06 dataset has been created for these countries: CH, NO, KO, TR, IE. A simplified border matching has been applied: - <25 ha polygons are NOT systematically removed (see next bullet). - Sliver-like polygons (area < cca. 5 ha - soft limit) are generalised to largest or thematically most similar neighbour. - CLC-code differences in polygons along two sides of the border are NOT changed Note: Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology, but has no impact for dataset contents and can be dissolved for data extracts.

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized. The resolution of the data is 100 x 100 and 250 x 250 metres (change grids 100 x 100 metres).Changes:Version 13 (02/2010) Production date: February 16th, 2010 This is the 13th CLC grid update and 5nd version containing also data from CLC2006 update (36 countries - only UK, CH and GR data still missing from complete CLC2006 coverage).

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Input data: Corine Land Cover 2000 - 2006 changes (file geodatabase v10)  Rasterisation using gdal_rasterize from GDAL 1.9.0 command line utilities - Loop through the list of layers, and generate the layers as defined there, see the shell script [0] and the list of layers (layer_code.list) [1].  - Thereby translating the 3-digit CLC codes (111...999) into grid codes within the 8-bit  range (0...44), see clc_legend.csv [2] - And eventually adding the usual CLC colour table to the generated GeoTIFF, by using a pre-defined vrt file, see [3]  [0]: docs/rasterize.sh [1]: docs/layer_code.list [2]: docs/clc_legend.csv [3]: docs/legend_100.vrt","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/ds_resolveuid/ac3a9aae-8748-4176-9729-808852fd960e","","","","",Land cover,environment,geoscientificInformation]

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.eu.","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa- Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country). National data, when transformed into the common European reference, are introduced into tiled pan-European structure and as final step seamless dataset is produced. In order to achieve production of the real seamless European database, the integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. It consists from edgematching of land cover polygons from the national databases across national borders done by a verification / re-interpretation of the satellite images in the border regions (2 km wide strip along borders). The satellite images from IMAGE2000. CLC90, CHA00 and CLC00 database were harmonized this way, but the order to priority was as following: CLC2000, both geometric and thematic adaptations of all polygons in a 2 km strip along national boundary lines; CHA00 database to ensure that changes in CLC2000 are consistent with the change database; corrected CLC90 (if provided by the MS); corrections were focused to geometric adaptations in semi-automatical way based on CLC00 and CHA00 databases. Border harmonization step has been skipped for CHA06 dataset and for CLC00 revised dataset. Simplified border harmonization step for CLC06 dataset has been created for these countries: CH, NO, KO, TR, IE. A simplified border matching has been applied: - <25 ha polygons are NOT systematically removed (see next bullet). - Sliver-like polygons (area < cca. 5 ha - soft limit) are generalised to largest or thematically most similar neighbour. - CLC-code differences in polygons along two sides of the border are NOT changed Note: Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology, but has no impact for dataset contents and can be dissolved for data extracts.

The EEA coastline is a product derived from two sources: EUHYDRO [link not available - yet] and GSHHG [http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhg/]  A priority defined in the input data, first EUHYDRO geometry and, as auxiliary data, GSHHG dataset. The EUHYDRO do not cover the requirement for EEA coastline. The EUHYDRO gaps are in Iceland, Canarias, Madeira, Azores, small islands (not represented in EUDEM) and the northern of Black Sea. The creation process was focused on generating the coastline as line dataset and, later, as a secondary product, defining the polygon layer sea-land. The fundamental step into the workflow was the selection of sea features using a water mask polygon (value in EUHYDRO datasets = 255). The inland water bodies (freshwaters) are rejected by this criteria, except the water bodies connected, at least by one point, to the sea (it is the cases of some transitional water bodies). A few manual amendments to the dataset were necessary to meet requirements from EU Nature Directives, Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive.  This dataset is a polygon usable as a water-land mask.","Polygon: the polygon was derived from the parent dataset by adding two straight lines, one North-to-South, at the East-most part of the parent dataset, and the second one West-to-East, at the South–most part of the parent dataset. These 2 lines are taken from the NGA-derived coastline produced by the ETC-BD in 2008.

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether.

This feature is more uncertain than the other ones since it results from the processing of different sources under a twin constraint of relevance and free of charges accessibility. The current layer comprises 70,847 lake objects, that will certainly be updated in the months to come. A lake is, as a river both a geometric and cultural object. In areas where many lakes are intertwined, the difference between one and several lakes is often that a name has been found or not or that the Corine Land cover maker has placed a limit or not. The database comprises the following tables: feature class C_Lak with all information related to all still waterbodies which area is more than the Corine Land cover threshold, plus those identified because a reservoir or any other relevant source. This table is completed by the centroids of lakes, V_lak_Centro. The complex relationships between lakes and river segments are documented by table lakInOut where the inlet and the outlet(s) segments are reported. Complementary tables, needed by the water accounts, v_lakperadmin et v_linterfec respectively document the lake to administrative entities, with shared area and same with FECs. Being in relation with the other components of Ecrins, lakes are versioned with respect to catchments and rivers and with their update as well. Lake naming comes from fours sources: ERM, Eldred2, Art 13 reporting and Wikipedia. Hydrographical information (volume, Zaverage, Zmax) and is permanently updated from three source: Eldred2, the dams database,  and Wikipedia  In version 1.0, the history of lakes is not documented. Most natural lakes have a time span much before and beyond the expected duration of Ecrins. Artificial lakes, related to dams have their history documented with the dam and some natural lakes are intermittent. This last category is not documented. Since lower limit for lake inclusion is 25 ha, all “main lakes” under the WFD acceptation are present (except if missed for any reason, the most likely being creation of an artificial reservoir not present in the latest update). Full documentation is in EEA technical report 9/2012, downloadable from the EEA website.","Main source is Corine Land cover 2006, checked against ERM lakes layer for identifying relevance of Corine Land cover classification. Secondary sources are Eldred2 (EEA dams database) and WFD Art 13 deliveries. For example, a large dams mentioned in Eldred with a lake of sufficient area is verified against the lake layer and eventual correction on Corine Land cover is carried out; this was often the case for narrow and long reservoirs on rivers that are frequently clustered, forgotten or ill-classified in Corine Land cover. The presence of lake in different sources is mentioned in the C_lak table and if possible the ID of the source element reported as well as the ID of the matched ERM lake, hence making a bridge between the Ecrins (operational data set) and the user of ERM (geographical data set). Lake naming comes pro-parte from ERM, when a match is found and verified against other sources, from Art 13 reporting and from Wikipedia. Lakes matched to Wikipedia entries are as well flagged.","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/ds_resolveuid/401cd8dc-349e-4b38-8acc-d862460d0491","","","","",Hydrography,hydrography,inlandWaters]

With the help of CLC data it is possible to provide support for protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive. CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Input data: Corine Land Cover 2000 revised (file geodatabase v10)  Rasterisation using gdal_rasterize from GDAL 1.9.0 command line utilities - Loop through the list of layers, and generate the layers as defined there, see the shell script [0] and the list of layers (layer_code.list) [1].  - Thereby translating the 3-digit CLC codes (111...999) into grid codes within the 8-bit  range (0...44), see clc_legend.csv [2] - And eventually adding the usual CLC colour table to the generated GeoTIFF, by using a pre-defined vrt file, see [3]  [0]: docs/rasterize.sh [1]: docs/layer_code.list [2]: docs/clc_legend.csv [3]: docs/legend_100.vrt","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","","","","","",Land cover,environment]

Irrigation consumption refers to the part of the irrigation water that is really “consumed” by the crops and evapotranspirates (net irrigation requirements).The amount of water used for irrigation has been calculated for the base year based on the baseline climate (1961-90). It must be noted that the future irrigation water requirements were calculated within SCENES, i.e. the climate change input differs from the climate data used in the ClimWatAdapt framework because another emission scenario and different GCM output were applied. The assessment is performed on the river basin level for average annual conditions as well as for the summer season (JJA). This indicator does not consider the reduction of natural flow by upstream consumptive use, thus the water resources are only available for irrigation.By using this indicator, it is assumed that a drainage basin suffers from severe water stress if c.t.a. > 0.3 or, in other words, if irrigation consumption exceeds 40% of reliable annual (or seasonal) water availability. A c.t.a. below 0.3 indicates low to mid water stress. The thresholds are chosen arbitrarily but have been derived from EEA (2003) which shows a figure for the water consumption index ranging from (almost) zero to 30% in Europe. According to EEA (2003), the average water consumption index in Europe is 3%.","The annual water consumption for irrigation is modelled by WaterGAP. The water consumption for irrigation during June, July and August is calculated by dividing the annual water consumption for irrigation by 4.

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Input data: Corine Land Cover 1990 vector v16 (file geodatabase v10)  Rasterisation using gdal_rasterize from GDAL 1.9.0 command line utilities - Loop through the list of layers, and generate the layers as defined there, see the shell script [0] and the list of layers (layer_code.list) [1].  - Thereby translating the 3-digit CLC codes (111...999) into grid codes within the 8-bit  range (0...44), see clc_legend.csv [2] - And eventually adding the usual CLC colour table to the generated GeoTIFF, by using a pre-defined vrt file, see [3]  [0]: docs/rasterize.sh [1]: docs/layer_code.list [2]: docs/clc_legend.csv [3]: legend_250.vrt","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/ds_resolveuid/b9f4de00-12cc-4e12-bcac-ab64e3676965","","","","",Land cover,environment,geoscientificInformation]

The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) obtained elevation data on a near-global scale to generate the most complete high-resolution digital topographic database of Earth. SRTM consisted of a specially modified radar system that flew onboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour during an 11-day mission in February of 2000. SRTM is an international project spearheaded by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Version 2 of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital topographic data (also known as the  finished  version). was used for generation of this dataset. Version 2 is the result of a substantial editing effort by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and exhibits well-defined water bodies and coastlines and the absence of spikes and wells (single pixel errors), although some areas of missing data ('voids') are still present. The Version 2 directory also contains the vector coastline mask derived by NGA during the editing, called the SRTM Water Body Data (SWBD), in ESRI Shapefile format. DTED (or Digital Terrain Elevation Data) was originally developed in the 1970s to support aircraft radar simulation and prediction. DTED supports many applications, including line-of-sight analyses, terrain profiling, 3-D terrain visualization, mission planning/rehearsal, and modeling and simulation. DTED is a standard NGA product that provides medium resolution, quantitative data in a digital format for military system applications that require terrain elevation. The DTED format for level 0, 1 and 2 is described in U.S. Military Specification Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) MIL-PRF-89020B, and amongst others describe the resolution: Level 0 used for geneation of this dataset has a post spacing of 30 arcseconds in latitude direction (ca. 900 meters)","1.

Definition in WFD: River basin district means the area of land and sea, made up of one or more neighbouring river basins together with their associated groundwaters and coastal waters, which is identified under Article 3(1) as the main unit for management of river basins. MS did not consistently include coastal waters in the RBD deliveries. Geographical coverage: EU Member States + Norway + Switzerland + neighbouring, international RBDs in non-EU Member States (derived from CCM1 catchments, JRC). The feature layer can be divided into four groupings by the following queries (in ArcGIS: copy and paste the query into the 'Definition Query' window in the layer properties): EU Member State RBDs: [EU_MS] = 'Y'; non-EU Member State RBDs: [EU_MS] = 'N' AND [intCode] = ''; EU Member State international RBDs: [INTERNATIONAL] = 'Y' AND [EU_MS] = 'Y'; Non-EU Member State international RBDs: [EU_MS] = 'N' AND [INTERNATIONAL] = 'Y'.","The European feature layer was originally created from country submissions under WFD, Art. 3, by JRC. Member States were asked to deliver data preferably at scale 1:250 000 but scale 1:1 000 000 were accepted. The European feature layer was further processed by WRc: 'Districts.shp' was downloaded from the JRC WISE website on June 2007 using the Synchronise Shape Files function. The European dataset were border harmonised using EuroGlobalMap 1:1 000 000 boundaries. The resulting dataset is considered as 1:1 000 000, even if individual RBDs may be much more detailed. The dataset was processed so the four RBD groupings (EU Member State/non-EU Member State, international/non-international) can be identified, see Abstract. The feature layers was handed over to EEA December 2007. CHANGES:Changes done at EEA in Jan-Feb 2008, version F1v0: The four feature layers (the four RBD groupings) from WRc were merged into one single feature layer to ensure geometrical consistency between the layers. Updates of Norwegian and Swedish RBDs. Geometry was corrected (gaps and overlaps removed). New attributes was appended. Changes from F1v0 to F1v1: Only changes in the attributes because of requirements in the WISE viewer. The 'ID' field was re-introduced. Corrections in 'MSCD_RBD' field.

The WFD is the main driver of creation of such aggregates. The uppermost aggregate of the WFD is the “river basin district” that is not hydrological entity. It is analysed as i) all those FECS being in majority in the official RBD delineation, ii) all those FECs, topologically connected, that are the closet shaping of the RBD, the “functional RBD”. For example, the upper Garonne is in the first case attached the Ebro RBD and to the Garonne functional RBD because the water empties in the Gironde, not in the Mediterranean RBD sizes lay in a wide range. Two categories of sub-basins have been designed, the “sub-basins Strahler, aggregated from a Strahler order criterion and the natural sub-basins, aggregated from a main affluent criterion. Both apportion functional RBDs. The tables are C_B, the catchments that empty on a se-shore (as the seas from SeaVox, care taken of islands: e.g. England and France vs. British Channel are different C_B, despite same sea shore) RBD_Int_clp are the RBDs, dissolved as international RBDs; C_FRBD functional RBDs C_SS: sub-basins based on Strahler definition, C_SB: sub-basins natural C_NUTS: harmonised table of “pseudo nuts” used to document FECs (largest share of FEC in a NUT).

The introductions of Q95 as minimum water requirements for aquatic ecosystems can be seen to be important, e.g., fish ecologists focused particularly on the protection of low flows.Currently, the natural flow regime is being modified at many rivers by anthropogenic activities such as river regulation, channelization, water abstractions and land-use changes. An additional threat is climate change, which may severely alter river hydrology over large regional scales in the future. Increasing temperatures will cause a reduction in runoff due to higher evapotranspiration values and changing precipitation amounts and patterns lead to lower or higher runoff in the future (IPCC 2007). The methodology applied to estimate the future status of environmental flows follows the recommendation from Acreman et al. (2008) to use Q95 as minimum flow for maintaining healthy aquatic ecosystems, as this is a critical threshold where no abstractions out of the river are allowed in UK.","1) Calculation of Q95 for all hydrological scenarios for the baseline and 2050s on a NUTS-2 level2) Comparison of future Q95 to baseline conditions.

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized.

It is an ecological network of protected areas, set up to ensure the survival of Europe's most valuable species and habitats. Natura 2000 is based on the 1979 Bird's Directive and the 1992 Habitat's Directive.  Natura 2000 is an ecological network composed of sites designated under the Birds Directive (Special Protection Areas, SPAs) and the Habitats Directive (Sites of Community Importance, SCIs, and Special Areas of Conservation, SACs).   For each Natura 2000 site, national authorities have submitted a standard data form (SDF) that contains an extensive description of the site and its ecology. The European Topic Centre for Biological Diversity (ETC/BD), based in Paris, is responsible for validating these datasets and for creating an EU wide descriptive database .   The European database on Natura 2000 sites consists of data submitted by Member States to the European Commission. The European database is generally updated once per year, so as to take into account any updating of the content of the national databases by Member States. After validation a new EU-wide Natura 2000 database is released.  However, the release of a new EU-wide database does not provide any guarantee that a particular national dataset has recently been updated.   The spatial data (borders of sites) submitted by each Member State is validated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and linked to the descriptive data. Any problems identified during this process are brought to the attention of the concerned Member States.   There are specific terms and conditions relating to the use of downloaded boundary data within the United Kingdom. If you intend to use the UK data you must first agree to the end user licence http://www.jncc.gov.uk/page-5232.   Please note that some Member States have submitted sensitive information that has been filtered out of this database. The following Member States have submitted sensitive information: Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Sweden and United Kingdom. This concerns mainly species associated to specific sites. All reference to these species has been removed from the related sites. If this sensitive information is necessary to your field of research, please contact the Member States' administrations individually.

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Input data: Corine Land Cover 1990 vector v16 (file geodatabase v10)  Rasterisation using gdal_rasterize from GDAL 1.9.0 command line utilities - Loop through the list of layers, and generate the layers as defined there, see the shell script [0] and the list of layers (layer_code.list) [1].  - Thereby translating the 3-digit CLC codes (111...999) into grid codes within the 8-bit  range (0...44), see clc_legend.csv [2] - And eventually adding the usual CLC colour table to the generated GeoTIFF, by using a pre-defined vrt file, see [3]  [0]: docs/rasterize.sh [1]: docs/layer_code.list [2]: docs/clc_legend.csv [3]: legend_100.vrt","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/ds_resolveuid/b9f4de00-12cc-4e12-bcac-ab64e3676965","","","","",Land cover,environment,geoscientificInformation]

Sub basins are defined  using the catchment area of big tributaries as much as possible, and subdividing the main course of the river into upper, medium, and lower parts of the basin. The target is having a spatially homogeneous, but still with hydrological meaning units. These subdivisions are nested when river basins are big and tributaries drain a surface bigger than 40,000 square Kilometres, which in the case of Danube and Volga makes up to 3 levels of sub basins.","The natural sub basins layer is derived from ECRINS FECs. The process for creating them consists of a semi-automated procedure by which first FECs belonging to basins bigger than 40,000 square Kilometres are selected. Inside that basin, tributaries to the main river with a drainage surface bigger than 10,000 square Kilometres are taken as separate sub basins. If the area of an individual sub basin is bigger than 40,000 square Kilometres, then it is further subdivided as a normal basin. This loop continues until there is no tributary left with a surface bigger than 40,000 square Kilometres.   In big river basins, nested subdivisions occur when the resulting sub basin divided using main tributaries happen to be bigger than 40,000 square Kilometres. The main course of the river after removing tributaries can still have a surface bigger than 40,000 square Kilometres. In such case, it is further subdivided by manually selecting the last FEC downstream of the upper sub basin. The selection is made taking into consideration the shape of the basin, the proximity of other subdivision because of big tributaries, the presence of tributaries below the 10,000 square Kilometres threshold, and the surface upstream not being subdivided yet to be bigger than 10,000 and smaller than 40,000 square Kilometres.  This classification is done editing FECs’ attribute SB. After that they are dissolved with multipart option, and using the field SB, into the sub basins.","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","","","","","",Hydrography,hydrography,inlandWaters]

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Input data: Corine Land Cover 2000 vector v16 (file geodatabase v10)  Rasterisation using gdal_rasterize from GDAL 1.9.0 command line utilities - Loop through the list of layers, and generate the layers as defined there, see the shell script [0] and the list of layers (layer_code.list) [1].  - Thereby translating the 3-digit CLC codes (111...999) into grid codes within the 8-bit  range (0...44), see clc_legend.csv [2] - And eventually adding the usual CLC colour table to the generated GeoTIFF, by using a pre-defined vrt file, see [3]  [0]: docs/rasterize.sh [1]: docs/layer_code.list [2]: docs/clc_legend.csv [3]: docs/legend_250.vrt","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/ds_resolveuid/b13985d2-34d3-4310-9d2e-9ddedb86e42f","","","","",Land cover,environment,geoscientificInformation]
