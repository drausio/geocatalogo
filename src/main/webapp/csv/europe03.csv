"caca3b89-d60b-4949-a556-e15c198b8faf","eng","2012-11-12T10:18:55","WISE provisional reference GIS Water Framework Directive (WFD) dataset on Groundwater Bodies - INTERNAL VERSION, Oct. 2012","","A Groundwater Body (GWB) under the Water Framework Directive (WFD) Art. 2 is defined as a distinct volume of groundwater within an aquifer or aquifers, whereas an aquifer is defined as a geological layer with significant groundwater flow. This definition of a GWB allows a wide scope of interpretations. EU Member States (MS) are under obligation to report the GWBs including the results of the GWB survey periodically according to the schedule of the WFD. Reportnet is used for the submission of GWB data to the EEA by MS and includes spatial data as GIS polygons and GWB characteristics in an XML schema.  The WISE provisional reference GIS WFD Dataset on GWBs combines spatial data consisting of several shape files and certain GWB attributes in a single table submitted by the MS according to Art. 13. The GWBs are divided into horizons, which represent distinct vertical layers of groundwater resources. All GWBs assigned to a certain horizon from one to five are merged into one shape file. GWBs assigned to horizons six or seven are combined in a single further shape file. Another two shape files comprise the GWBs of Reunion Island in the southern hemisphere and the GWBs from Switzerland as a non EU MS, all of which assigned to horizon 1.  The dbf tables of the shape files include the columns “EU_CD_GW” as the GWB identifier and “Horizon” describing the vertical positioning. The polygon identifier “Polygon_ID” was added subsequently, because some GWBs consist of several polygons with identical “EU_CD_GW”even in the same horizon. Some further GWB characteristics are provided with the Microsoft Excel file “GWB_attributes_2012June.xls” including the column “EU_CD_GW”, which serves as a key for joining spatial and attribute data. There is no corresponding spatial data for GWBs in the Microsoft Excel table without an entry in column “EU_CD_GW”. The spatial resolution is given for about a half of the GWBs in the column “Scale” of the xls file, which is varying between the MS from 1 : 10,000 to 1 : 1,000,000 and mostly in the range from 1 : 50,000 to 1 : 250,000. The processing of some of the GWB shape files by GIS routines as clip or intersect in combination with a test polygon resulted in errors. Therefore a correction of erroneous topological features causing routine failures was carried out. However, the GWB layer includes a multitude of in parts very tiny, distinct areas resulting in a highly detailed or fragmented pattern. In certain parts topological inconsistencies appear quite frequently and delineation methodologies are currently varying between the MS in terms of size and three dimensional positioning of GWBs. This version of the dataset has to be considered as a first step towards a consistent GWB picture throughout Europe, but it is not yet of a sufficient quality to support spatial analyses i.e. it is not a fully developed reference GIS dataset. Therefore, the layer is published as a preliminary version and use of this data is subject
to certain restrictions outlined in the explanatory notes.   It should be underlined that the methodology used is still under discussion (Working Group C -Groundwater) and is not fully harmonised throughout the EU MS.   For the external publication the whole United Kingdom has to be removed due to licensing restrictions.","Spatial data of GWBs was delivered by MS in a shape format, whereas many MS stored the data in separate shape files for River Basin Districts (RBD) or horizons or both. The attribute tables of the provided shape files always implied the mandatory fields of GWB code named “EU_CD_GW” and GWB horizon partially accompanied by varying extra columns defined by the Member States. All GWBs had been merged into separate shape files according to their affiliation to horizons, but with extra shapes for Reunion and Switzerland. The attribute tables of these shape files exclusively adopt the fields “EU_CD_GW” and GWB. Because the GWB identifier “EU_CD_GW” is not unique for the polygons an artificial polygon identifier “Polygon_ID” is appended to the attribute table. The linking between the shape files and the Microsoft Excel table GWB_attributes_2012June.xls, which comprises further attributes deriving from the WFD reporting via XML files, has to be carried out using the column EU_CD_GW as key for joining the tables.","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","","","","","",Hydrography,Area management/restriction/regulation zones and reporting units,groundwater,aquifer,inlandWaters]

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services.

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and  space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.europa.eu","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa- Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country). National data, when transformed into the common European reference, are introduced into tiled pan-European structure and as final step seamless dataset is produced. In order to achieve production of the real seamless European database, the integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. It consists from edgematching of land cover polygons from the national databases across national borders done by a verification / re-interpretation of the satellite images in the border regions (2 km wide strip along borders). The satellite images from IMAGE2000. CLC90, CHA00 and CLC00 database were harmonized this way, but the order to priority was as following: CLC2000, both geometric and thematic adaptations of all polygons in a 2 km strip along national boundary lines; CHA00 database to ensure that changes in CLC2000 are consistent with the change database; corrected CLC90 (if provided by the MS); corrections were focused to geometric adaptations in semi-automatical way based on CLC00 and CHA00 databases. Border harmonization step has been skipped for CHA06 dataset and for CLC00 revised dataset. Simplified border harmonization step for CLC06 dataset has been created for these countries: CH, NO, KO, TR, IE. A simplified border matching has been applied: - <25 ha polygons are NOT systematically removed (see next bullet). - Sliver-like polygons (area < cca. 5 ha - soft limit) are generalised to largest or thematically most similar neighbour. - CLC-code differences in polygons along two sides of the border are NOT changed Note: Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology, but has no impact for dataset contents and can be dissolved for data extracts.

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

It stretches from the seaward edge of the state territorial sea out to 200 nautical miles from its coast. The data set has been derived from the World Maritime Boundaries v5.0 dataset from the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ) and integrated with the datasets &quot;Communes 2010 – European Commission, Eurostat/GISCO&quot;, &quot;Countries 2010, European Commission - Eurostat/GISCO&quot;, &quot;Coastlines 2010, European Commission - Eurostat/GISCO&quot;. The data set (100K - 60M) is available to EEA due to EEA having a valid EBM v5.0 licence.    These metadata are derived from the original metadata records available at Inspire@EC.","The dataset is based on the European Boundary Map v5.0. from EuroGeographics (scale 1:100.000) (for Eurogeographics members) and the Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL) 2008 from FAO (UN) (scale 1:1M and smaller). These datasets were integrated in a common repository of geometry (including EEZ boundaries) of which the different datasets were derived. The different scale levels were derived of generalisations of the common repository on 100K scale.

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized. The resolution of the data is 100 x 100 and 250 x 250 metres (change grids 100 x 100 metres).

A water stress indicator is defined as the total withdrawal of freshwater resources in relation to the long-term average availability of the freshwater water resources within a river (sub)basin. One of the most important indicators for water scarcity or water stress is the water exploitation index (WEI) or water stress indicator (w.t.a.), which is defined as the total water withdrawals-to-water availability ratio within a river basin. Water scarcity can be the result of intensive water use, low water availability (climate driven) or a combination of these pressures. The indicator provides to policy makers a quick overview of areas that may encounter water shortage problems. WEI or a w.t.a.-value between 0.0 and 0.2 is considered a low water stress, WEI between 0.2 and 0.4medium water stress, and a value greater than 0.4 severe water stress. This variant of the water exploitation index is defined as the ratio of water withdrawals in all sectors to water availability. Annual WEI is calculated on a river basin level for the baseline and the 2050s. Here, baseline conditions are defined as water availability averaged over the climate normal period 1961-90 and water withdrawals for the year 2005. For the 2050s, water availability is averaged over the period 2041-2070 (2050s) and calculated as the median of the hydrological simulations. Total water withdrawals are represented by two different socio-economic scenarios, the SCENES scenarios “Economy First” (EcF) and “Sustainability Eventually” (SuE).","The water withdrawals are calculated by WaterGAP, and results for the SCENES scenarios “Economy First” (EcF) and “Sustainability Eventually” (SuE) are selected (Annex 3). Water availability is computed as the median of an ensemble of LISFLOOD simulations driven by climate projections of 11 different GCM-RCM combinations (see Annex 3, Table 1) for the period 2041-2070 (representing 2050s). The climate projections are taken from the ENSEMBLES project and are based on the SRES A1B scenario (Annex 3).","urn:ogc:def:crs:::EPSG:4258","","","","","","","OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map",water management,water stress,WEI,ClimWatAdapt,water,Atmospheric conditions,climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere]

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.eu.","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered . Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country). National data, when transformed into the common European reference, are introduced into tiled pan-European structure and as final step seamless dataset is produced. In order to achieve production of the real seamless European database, the integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. It consists from edge-matching of land cover polygons from the national databases across national borders done by a verification / re-interpretation of the satellite images in the border regions (2 km wide strip along borders). The satellite images from IMAGE2000. CLC90, CHA00 and CLC00 database were harmonized this way, but the order to priority was as following: CLC2000, both geometric and thematic adaptations of all polygons in a 2 km strip along national boundary lines; CHA00 database to ensure that changes in CLC2000 are consistent with the change database; corrected CLC90 (if provided by the MS); corrections were focused to geometric adaptations in semi-automatical way based on CLC00 and CHA00 databases. Border harmonization step has been skipped for CHA06 and CLC06 datasets. Note: Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology, but has no impact for dataset contents and can be dissolved for data extracts.

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.eu","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized. The resolution of the data is 100 x 100 and 250 x 250 metres (change grids 100 x 100 metres).","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","","","","","",Land cover,environment,geoscientificInformation]

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

Estonia (DATA_SRC = EE): The population data for non Census years is only available on municipality level (LAU2). The 2006 population gridmap is an estimation which is based on different datasets - 2011 Census building centroids (contains also building addresses and coordinates), persons address data from population register, data about new buildings from buildings register and the official 2006 population counts on municipalities level. Buildings that were built between 2006 and 2011 were excluded. Based on building centroids the 2006 population in municipalities were calculated and the numbers were compared to the official population counts for the year 2006. If there were differences between the two numbers then the missing/redundant number of persons were added/deleted to/from randomly selected buildings within the same municipality.

The projection onto an Inspire compliant grid of 25m resolution has been performed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission.","The EU-DEM data product is derived from an automated data fusion process using SRTM and ASTER GDEM digital surface model (DSM) data. Intermap's NEXTMap Europe dataset is utilized to remove any consistent horizontal bias in the GDEM data. The EU-DEM product is edited to ensure that water features are adequately represented and consistent with the hydrography layer provided by Aerogeodezijos Institutas (AGI) in Kaunas, Lithuania. Residual clouds within the GDEM data are identified and removed same as suspect data extremely differing from the SRTM data. All EU-DEM tiles are edited interactively in a 3D stereo environment. The editing is restricted to the hydrographic features and pits and bumps. In areas above 60 degress North, the EU-DEM generation process is supported by other DEM data sources provided by JRC. Water features are flattened (oceans, lakes) and stepped (rivers) based on the hydrography data produced by AGI. The spatial reference system of the original EU-DEM is geographic, lat/lon with horizontal datum ETRS89, ellipsoid GRS80 and vertical datum EVRS2000 with geoid EGG08.

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.eu.","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered . Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country). National data, when transformed into the common European reference, are introduced into tiled pan-European structure and as final step seamless dataset is produced. In order to achieve production of the real seamless European database, the integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. It consists from edge-matching of land cover polygons from the national databases across national borders done by a verification / re-interpretation of the satellite images in the border regions (2 km wide strip along borders). The satellite images from IMAGE2000. CLC90, CHA00 and CLC00 database were harmonized this way, but the order to priority was as following: CLC2000, both geometric and thematic adaptations of all polygons in a 2 km strip along national boundary lines; CHA00 database to ensure that changes in CLC2000 are consistent with the change database; corrected CLC90 (if provided by the MS); corrections were focused to geometric adaptations in semi-automatical way based on CLC00 and CHA00 databases. Note: Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology, but has no impact for dataset contents and can be dissolved for data extracts.

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Input data: Corine Land Cover 2006 vector v17 (file geodatabase v10)  Rasterisation using gdal_rasterize from GDAL 1.9.0 command line utilities - Loop through the list of layers, and generate the layers as defined there, see the shell script [0] and the list of layers (layer_code.list) [1].  - Thereby translating the 3-digit CLC codes (111...999) into grid codes within the 8-bit  range (0...44), see clc_legend.csv [2] - And eventually adding the usual CLC colour table to the generated GeoTIFF, by using a pre-defined vrt file, see [3]  [0]: docs/rasterize.sh [1]: docs/layer_code.list [2]: docs/clc_legend.csv [3]: docs/legend_250.vrt","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/ds_resolveuid/a47ee0d3248146908f72a8fde9939d9d","","","","",Land cover,environment]

The defining criteria was altitude level = 0 from EUDEM [will become available from EEA website]. Outside the coverage of the EUDEM, the coastline from GSHHG was used without modifications. A few manual amendments to the dataset were necessary to meet requirements from EU Nature Directives, Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive. In 2015, several corrections were made in the Kalogeroi Islands (coordinates 38.169, 25.287) and two other Greek little islets (coordinates 36.766264, 23.604318), as well as in the peninsula of Porkkala (around coordinates 59.99, 24.42).

The geographic area of some RBDs span more than one country (such as the Danube) and these are known as International RBDs. Others are contained completely within a country and are known as National RBDs. River basin districts are defined as the area of land and sea, made up of one or more neighbouring river basins together with their associated groundwaters and coastal waters, which is identified under Article 3(1) as the main unit for management of river basins. Coastal waters are defined as one nautical mile from the coastline and extending, where appropriate, up to the outer limit of transitional waters. Coastal waters are included in RBDs, but this is not consistenly reported by Member States. Transitional waters are defined as bodies of surface water in the vicinity of river mouths which are partly saline in character as a result of their proximity to coastal waters but which are substantially influenced by freshwater flows.

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

Irrigation consumption refers to the part of the irrigation water that is really “consumed” by the crops and evapotranspirates (net irrigation requirements).The amount of water used for irrigation has been calculated for the base year based on the baseline climate (1961-90). It must be noted that the future irrigation water requirements were calculated within SCENES, i.e. the climate change input differs from the climate data used in the ClimWatAdapt framework because another emission scenario and different GCM output were applied. The assessment is performed on the river basin level for average annual conditions as well as for the summer season (JJA). This indicator does not consider the reduction of natural flow by upstream consumptive use, thus the water resources are only available for irrigation.By using this indicator, it is assumed that a drainage basin suffers from severe water stress if c.t.a. > 0.3 or, in other words, if irrigation consumption exceeds 40% of reliable annual (or seasonal) water availability. A c.t.a. below 0.3 indicates low to mid water stress. The thresholds are chosen arbitrarily but have been derived from EEA (2003) which shows a figure for the water consumption index ranging from (almost) zero to 30% in Europe. According to EEA (2003), the average water consumption index in Europe is 3%.","The annual water consumption for irrigation is modelled by WaterGAP. The water consumption for irrigation during June, July and August is calculated by dividing the annual water consumption for irrigation by 4. The water availability during June, July and August is modelled by LISFLOOD.","urn:ogc:def:crs:::EPSG:4258","","","","","","","OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map",water management,agriculture,irrigation,ClimWatAdapt,water,Atmospheric conditions,climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere]

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.eu.","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered . Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country). National data, when transformed into the common European reference, are introduced into tiled pan-European structure and as final step seamless dataset is produced. In order to achieve production of the real seamless European database, the integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. It consists from edge-matching of land cover polygons from the national databases across national borders done by a verification / re-interpretation of the satellite images in the border regions (2 km wide strip along borders). The satellite images from IMAGE2000. CLC90, CHA00 and CLC00 database were harmonized this way, but the order to priority was as following: CLC2000, both geometric and thematic adaptations of all polygons in a 2 km strip along national boundary lines; CHA00 database to ensure that changes in CLC2000 are consistent with the change database; corrected CLC90 (if provided by the MS); corrections were focused to geometric adaptations in semi-automatical way based on CLC00 and CHA00 databases. Border harmonization step has been skipped for CHA06 and CLC06 datasets. Note: Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology, but has no impact for dataset contents and can be dissolved for data extracts.","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/ds_resolveuid/9ac30da297322db802a447ba46b35e59","","","","",Land cover,environment,geoscientificInformation]

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale.

The evaluation of the soil’s natural susceptibility is based on the creation of logical connections between relevant parameters (pedotransfer rules). The input parameters for these pedotransfer rules are taken from the attributes of the European soil database, e.g. soil properties: type, texture and water regime, depth to textural change and the limitation of the soil for agricultural use. Besides the main parameters auxiliary parameters have been used as impermeable layer, depth of an obstacle to roots, water management system, dominant and secondary land use. It was assumed that every soil, as a porous medium, could be compacted.  The map of natural soil susceptibility to compaction was created from the evaluation of selected parameters from the ESDB. The soil susceptibility to compaction was divided into 4 categories. Two additional categories represent the data concerning places where this evaluation was either not relevant or could not been provided because of lack of information. In total there are 6 categories (attribute  Evaluation  in the shapefile):      0 - no soil. This represents water bodies, glaciers and rock outcrops     1 - low susceptibility to compaction     2. - medium susceptibility to compaction     3. - high susceptibility to compaction     4. - very high susceptibility to compaction     9. - no evaluation possible.

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.eu.","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered . Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country). National data, when transformed into the common European reference, are introduced into tiled pan-European structure and as final step seamless dataset is produced. In order to achieve production of the real seamless European database, the integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. It consists from edge-matching of land cover polygons from the national databases across national borders done by a verification / re-interpretation of the satellite images in the border regions (2 km wide strip along borders). The satellite images from IMAGE2000. CLC90, CHA00 and CLC00 database were harmonized this way, but the order to priority was as following: CLC2000, both geometric and thematic adaptations of all polygons in a 2 km strip along national boundary lines; CHA00 database to ensure that changes in CLC2000 are consistent with the change database; corrected CLC90 (if provided by the MS); corrections were focused to geometric adaptations in semi-automatical way based on CLC00 and CHA00 databases. Border harmonization step has been skipped for CHA06 and CLC06 datasets. Note: Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology, but has no impact for dataset contents and can be dissolved for data extracts.

Residual clouds within the GDEM data are identified and removed same as suspect data extremely differing from the SRTM data. All EU-DEM tiles are edited interactively in a 3D stereo environment. The editing is restricted to the hydrographic features and pits and bumps. In areas above 60 degress North, the EU-DEM generation process is supported by other DEM data sources provided by JRC.

Some further GWB characteristics are provided with the Microsoft Excel file “GWB_attributes_2012June.xls” including the column “EU_CD_GW”, which serves as a key for joining spatial and attribute data. There is no corresponding spatial data for GWBs in the Microsoft Excel table without an entry in column “EU_CD_GW”.  The spatial resolution is given for about a half of the GWBs in the column “Scale” of the xls file, which is varying between the MS from 1:10,000 to 1:1,000,000 and mostly in the range from 1:50,000 to 1:250,000.","All GWBs assigned to horizon 1 are collected in the shape GWB_horizon_h1 regardless the structure of the shape files submitted by the MS with affiliation to horizons, River Basin Districts or both. The attribute table includes the fields “EU_CD_GW”, “Horizon” and the artificial polygon identifier “Polygon_ID”. The linking between the shape file and the Microsoft Excel table GWB_attributes_2012June.xls, which comprises further attributes, has to be carried out using the column EU_CD_GW as key for joining the dbf table of the shape file with the xls file.","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:4258","","","","","","","",Hydrography,Area management/restriction/regulation zones and reporting units,groundwater,aquifer,inlandWaters]

CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized.

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.europa.eu","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa- Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country). National data, when transformed into the common European reference, are introduced into tiled pan-European structure and as final step seamless dataset is produced. In order to achieve production of the real seamless European database, the integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. It consists from edgematching of land cover polygons from the national databases across national borders done by a verification / re-interpretation of the satellite images in the border regions (2 km wide strip along borders). The satellite images from IMAGE2000. CLC90, CHA00 and CLC00 database were harmonized this way, but the order to priority was as following: CLC2000, both geometric and thematic adaptations of all polygons in a 2 km strip along national boundary lines; CHA00 database to ensure that changes in CLC2000 are consistent with the change database; corrected CLC90 (if provided by the MS); corrections were focused to geometric adaptations in semi-automatical way based on CLC00 and CHA00 databases. Border harmonization step has been skipped for CHA06 dataset and for CLC00 revised dataset.

A simplified border matching has been applied: - <25 ha polygons are NOT systematically removed (see next bullet). - Sliver-like polygons (area < cca. 5 ha - soft limit) are generalised to largest or thematically most similar neighbour. - CLC-code differences in polygons along two sides of the border are NOT changed Note: Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology, but has no impact for dataset contents and can be dissolved for data extracts.

"01c9d364-6c84-4b3f-8feb-1b99eff56e07","eng","2013-04-23T17:48:03","WISE provisional reference GIS Water Framework Directive (WFD) dataset on Groundwater Bodies - PUBLIC VERSION, Oct. 2012","","A Groundwater Body (GWB) under the Water Framework Directive (WFD) Art. 2 is defined as a distinct volume of groundwater within an aquifer or aquifers, whereas an aquifer is defined as a geological layer with significant groundwater flow. This definition of a GWB allows a wide scope of interpretations. EU Member States (MS) are under obligation to report the GWBs including the results of the GWB survey periodically according to the schedule of the WFD. Reportnet is used for the submission of GWB data to the EEA by MS and includes spatial data as GIS polygons and GWB characteristics in an XML schema.  The WISE provisional reference GIS WFD Dataset on GWBs combines spatial data consisting of several shape files and certain GWB attributes in a single table submitted by the MS according to Art. 13. The GWBs are divided into horizons, which represent distinct vertical layers of groundwater resources. All GWBs assigned to a certain horizon from one to five are merged into one shape file. GWBs assigned to horizons six or seven are combined in a single further shape file. Another two shape files comprise the GWBs of Reunion Island in the southern hemisphere and the GWBs from Switzerland as a non EU MS, all of which assigned to horizon 1.  The dbf tables of the shape files include the columns “EU_CD_GW” as the GWB identifier and “Horizon” describing the vertical positioning. The polygon identifier “Polygon_ID” was added subsequently, because some GWBs consist of several polygons with identical “EU_CD_GW”even in the same horizon. Some further GWB characteristics are provided with the Microsoft Excel file “GWB_attributes_2012June.xls” including the column “EU_CD_GW”, which serves as a key for joining spatial and attribute data. There is no corresponding spatial data for GWBs in the Microsoft Excel table without an entry in column “EU_CD_GW”. The spatial resolution is given for about a half of the GWBs in the column “Scale” of the xls file, which is varying between the MS from 1 : 10,000 to 1 : 1,000,000 and mostly in the range from 1 : 50,000 to 1 : 250,000. The processing of some of the GWB shape files by GIS routines as clip or intersect in combination with a test polygon resulted in errors. Therefore a correction of erroneous topological features causing routine failures was carried out. However, the GWB layer includes a multitude of in parts very tiny, distinct areas resulting in a highly detailed or fragmented pattern. In certain parts topological inconsistencies appear quite frequently and delineation methodologies are currently varying between the MS in terms of size and three dimensional positioning of GWBs. This version of the dataset has to be considered as a first step towards a consistent GWB picture throughout Europe, but it is not yet of a sufficient quality to support spatial analyses i.e. it is not a fully developed reference GIS dataset. Therefore, the layer is published as a preliminary version and use of this data is subject
to certain restrictions outlined in the explanatory notes.   It should be underlined that the methodology used is still under discussion (Working Group C -Groundwater) and is not fully harmonised throughout the EU MS.   For the external publication the whole United Kingdom had to be removed due to licensing restrictions.","Spatial data of GWBs was delivered by MS in a shape format, whereas many MS stored the data in separate shape files for River Basin Districts (RBD) or horizons or both. The attribute tables of the provided shape files always implied the mandatory fields of GWB code named “EU_CD_GW” and GWB horizon partially accompanied by varying extra columns defined by the Member States. All GWBs had been merged into separate shape files according to their affiliation to horizons, but with extra shapes for Reunion and Switzerland. The attribute tables of these shape files exclusively adopt the fields “EU_CD_GW” and GWB. Because the GWB identifier “EU_CD_GW” is not unique for the polygons an artificial polygon identifier “Polygon_ID” is appended to the attribute table. The linking between the shape files and the Microsoft Excel table GWB_attributes_2012June.xls, which comprises further attributes deriving from the WFD reporting via XML files, has to be carried out using the column EU_CD_GW as key for joining the tables.","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/ds_resolveuid/28ab5e4028384e1484b6211d97c0f01d","","","","",Hydrography,Area management/restriction/regulation zones and reporting units,groundwater,aquifer,inlandWaters]

CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized. The resolution of the data is 100 x 100 and 250 x 250 metres (change grids 100 x 100 metres).","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","","","","","",Land cover,environment,geoscientificInformation]

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

In order to assess the vulnerability of the agricultural sector to climate change, the indicator “irrigation consumption-to-water availability” (c.t.a.) is introduced. Irrigation consumption refers to the part of the irrigation water that is really “consumed” by the crops and evapotranspirates (net irrigation requirements).The amount of water used for irrigation has been calculated for the base year based on the baseline climate (1961-90). It must be noted that the future irrigation water requirements were calculated within SCENES, i.e. the climate change input differs from the climate data used in the ClimWatAdapt framework because another emission scenario and different GCM output were applied. The assessment is performed on the river basin level for average annual conditions as well as for the summer season (JJA). This indicator does not consider the reduction of natural flow by upstream consumptive use, thus the water resources are only available for irrigation.By using this indicator, it is assumed that a drainage basin suffers from severe water stress if c.t.a. > 0.3 or, in other words, if irrigation consumption exceeds 40% of reliable annual (or seasonal) water availability. A c.t.a. below 0.3 indicates low to mid water stress. The thresholds are chosen arbitrarily but have been derived from EEA (2003) which shows a figure for the water consumption index ranging from (almost) zero to 30% in Europe. According to EEA (2003), the average water consumption index in Europe is 3%.","The annual water consumption for irrigation is modelled by WaterGAP. The water consumption for irrigation during June, July and August is calculated by dividing the annual water consumption for irrigation by 4. The water availability during June, July and August is modelled by LISFLOOD.","urn:ogc:def:crs:::EPSG:4258","","","","","","","OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map",water management,water stress,WEI,ClimWatAdapt,water,Atmospheric conditions,climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere]

With the help of CLC data it is possible to provide support for protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive.   CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized. The resolution of the data is 100 x 100 and 250 x 250 metres (change grids 100 x 100 metres).","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","","","","","",Land cover,environment,geoscientificInformation]

The modelled suitability map may be used as a proxy for the geographical distribution of the habitat type. Note however that it is not representing the actual distribution of the habitat type.","The database compiled for the Braun-Blanquet project is a compilation of various national and regional vegetation databases. The maintenance of these databases is in principle in the hands of the custodians. However, before uploading the databases into Braun-Blanquet database a quality check is performed by Alterra and Masaryk University. If possible, detected errors are corrected and reported back to the data provider. For the modelling of the habitat suitability map the Maxent software is used (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/). The grid values in the map represent the probability (ranging from 0-1) that the cell is suitable for the habitat. The grid file represents the habitat suitability of the EUNIS type. For the modelling the widely used software Maxent for maximum entropy modelling of species’ geographic distributions was used. Maxent is a general-purpose machine-learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modelling when only presence (occurrence) data but not absence data are available (Philips et al. 2006). Because EUNIS habitats have a particular species composition, they are assumed to respond to specific ecological requirements, allowing us to generate correlative estimates of geographic distributions. Modelling habitats that have been floristically defined is a well-known procedure for ecological modelling at local scales, and a promising technique to be applied also at the continental level.                  The Maxent method considers presence data (known observations of a given entity) and the so-called background data. Background data comprise a set of points used to describe the environmental variation of the study area according to the available environmental layers. It is assumed that these layers represent well the most important ecological gradients on a European scale. As layers the following environmental parameters have been used: Potential Evapotranspiration, Topsoil pH, Solar radiation, Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation *100), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter, Annual Precipitation, Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation), Precipitation of Warmest Quarter & Distance to water (rivers, lakes, sea).

With the help of CLC data it is possible to provide support for protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive.   CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc.. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit (5ha MMU for changes) into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized. The resolution of the data is 100 x 100 and 250 x 250 metres (change grids 100 x 100 metres).","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:3035","","","","","","","",Land cover,environment,geoscientificInformation]

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc.. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.eu.","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered . Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country). National data, when transformed into the common European reference, are introduced into tiled pan-European structure and as final step seamless dataset is produced. In order to achieve production of the real seamless European database, the integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. It consists from edge-matching of land cover polygons from the national databases across national borders done by a verification / re-interpretation of the satellite images in the border regions (2 km wide strip along borders). The satellite images from IMAGE2000. CLC90, CHA00 and CLC00 database were harmonized this way, but the order to priority was as following: CLC2000, both geometric and thematic adaptations of all polygons in a 2 km strip along national boundary lines; CHA00 database to ensure that changes in CLC2000 are consistent with the change database; corrected CLC90 (if provided by the MS); corrections were focused to geometric adaptations in semi-automatical way based on CLC00 and CHA00 databases. Note: Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology, but has no impact for dataset contents and can be dissolved for data extracts.

Communes are equivalent to Local Administrative Units, level 2 (LAU2), except for GR (LAU1) and SI (so called LAU3). The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) and the LAU nomenclature are hierarchical classifications of statistical regions that together subdivide the EU economic territory into regions of five different levels (NUTS 1, 2 and 3 and LAU 1, 2, respectively, moving from larger to smaller territorial units). The NUTS classification has been officially established through Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amendments. A non official NUTS-like classification has been defined for the non-EU countries. The LAU classification is not covered by any legislative act. An introduction to the NUTS classification is available here: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/nuts_nomenclature/introduction The data set is based on EuroBoundaryMap v. 5.0 from Eurogeographics. Geographical extent covers the European Union 27, EFTA countries, Croatia, Serbia (including Kosovo UNSCR 1244) Greenland, Moldova and Ukraine. The scale of the data set is 1:100 000. The data set (100K - 60M) is available to EEA due to EEA having a valid EBM v5.0 licence.    These metadata are derived from the original metadata records available at Inspire@EC.","The dataset is based on the geometry from EuroBoundary Map v5.0 (source EuroGeographics). This dataset was integrated in a common repository of geometry (including country and EEZ boundaries) of which the different datasets were derived. The different scale levels were derived of generalisations of the common repository on 100K scale. This means that within each scale level the feature classes of all these datasets: COMM_2010, NUTS_2010, CNTR_2010, EEZ_2010 and COAS_2010, are fully coherent and compliant. Each scale level in the COMM_2010 dataset consists of 2 feature classes (regions and boundaries) The boundaries and regions are related to each other through a relationship table. In addition to the region and boundary feature classes there is also 1 label feature class which is scale independent. For each Commune in the region feature class there is exactly 1 label. Further information on the validity and lineage is available in the database manual on the INSPIRE@EC group on CIRCABC. https://circabc.europa.eu/w/browse/bf8ae55b-a09b-4f24-a0b8-1f5784e0080c","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:4258","","","","","","","",Administrative units,administrative boundary,boundaries]

The Corine Land Cover (CLC) is an European programme, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA), providing consistent information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC products are based on the photointerpretation of satellite images by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA member or cooperating countries. The resulting national land cover inventories are further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database is based on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: - 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level Corine nomenclature - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares - minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres - minimum mapping unit (MMU) for Land Cover Changes (LCC) for change layers is 5 hectares CLC programme provides important data sets supporting the implementation of key priority areas of the Environment Action Programmes of the European Community as protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive etc. CLC programme is also a part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, which will provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring. More about the Corine Land Cover (CLC) programme and datasets can be found at http://www.eea.europa.eu/","Vector CLC database was provided by National Teams within original CLC1990, I&CLC2000 update and FTSP/CLC2006 update projects. All features in original vector database were classified and digitised based on satellite images with 100 m positional accuracy (according to CLC specifications) and 25 ha minimum mapping unit into the standardized CLC nomenclature (44 CLC classes). European Corine Land Cover seamless DBs represent the final product of European data integration. The process of data integration started when national deliveries have been accepted and the Database Acceptance Report (DBTA) delivered . Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard European coordinate reference - ETRS89/LAEA1052. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC data resolution (for more details see the DBTA reports for particular country). National data, when transformed into the common European reference, are introduced into tiled pan-European structure and as final step seamless dataset is produced. In order to achieve production of the real seamless European database, the integration step includes also harmonization of database along country borders. It consists from edge-matching of land cover polygons from the national databases across national borders done by a verification / re-interpretation of the satellite images in the border regions (2 km wide strip along borders). The satellite images from IMAGE2000. CLC90, CHA00 (changes 1990-2000) and CLC00 database were harmonized this way, but the order to priority was as following: CLC2000, both geometric and thematic adaptations of all polygons in a 2 km strip along national boundary lines; CHA00 database to ensure that changes in CLC2000 are consistent with the change database; corrected CLC90 (if provided by the MS); corrections were focused to geometric adaptations in semi-automatical way based on CLC00 and CHA00 databases. Border harmonization step has been skipped for CHA06 and CLC06 datasets. Note: Some artificial lines (dividing polygons with the same code) can be still present in database due to technical constraints of current ArcGIS technology, but has no impact for dataset contents and can be dissolved for data extracts.

One of the most important indicators for water scarcity or water stress is the water exploitation index (WEI) or water stress indicator (w.t.a.), which is defined as the total water withdrawals-to-water availability ratio within a river basin. Water scarcity can be the result of intensive water use, low water availability (climate driven) or a combination of these pressures. The indicator provides to policy makers a quick overview of areas that may encounter water shortage problems. WEI or a w.t.a.-value between 0.0 and 0.2 is considered a low water stress, WEI between 0.2 and 0.4medium water stress, and a value greater than 0.4 severe water stress. This variant of the water exploitation index is defined as the ratio of water withdrawals in all sectors to water availability. Annual WEI is calculated on a river basin level for the baseline and the 2050s. Here, baseline conditions are defined as water availability averaged over the climate normal period 1961-90 and water withdrawals for the year 2005. For the 2050s, water availability is averaged over the period 2041-2070 (2050s) and calculated as the median of the hydrological simulations. Total water withdrawals are represented by two different socio-economic scenarios, the SCENES scenarios “Economy First” (EcF) and “Sustainability Eventually” (SuE).","The water withdrawals are calculated by WaterGAP, and results for the SCENES scenarios “Economy First” (EcF) and “Sustainability Eventually” (SuE) are selected (Annex 3). Water availability is computed as the median of an ensemble of LISFLOOD simulations driven by climate projections of 11 different GCM-RCM combinations (see Annex 3, Table 1) for the period 2041-2070 (representing 2050s). The climate projections are taken from the ENSEMBLES project and are based on the SRES A1B scenario (Annex 3).","urn:ogc:def:crs:::EPSG:4258","","","","","","","OGC:WMS-1.1.1-http-get-map",water management,water stress,WEI,ClimWatAdapt,water,Atmospheric conditions,climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere]

The GAUL aims at compiling and disseminating the most reliable spatial information on administrative units for all the countries in the world, providing a contribution to the standardization of the spatial dataset representing administrative units. The GAUL always maintains global layers with a unified coding system at country, first (e.g. regions) and second administrative levels (e.g. districts). In addition, when data is available, it provides layers on a country by country basis down to third, fourth and lowers levels.  The GAUL is released once a year and the target beneficiary of the GAUL data is the UN community, the Universities and other authorized international and national institutions/agencies. Data might not be officially validated by authoritative national sources and can not be distributed to the general public. A disclaimer should always accompany any use of the GAUL data. About 21 countries have been updated respect to the previous release (see countries_updated.dbf). The GAUL keeps track of administrative units that has been changed, added or dismissed in the past for political causes. Changes implemented in different years are recorded in the GAUL on different layers. For this reason the GAUL product is not a single layer but a group of layers, named  GAUL Set  (see Gaul_Set.pdf).  The original dataset containing Level 0 administrative units has been combined by EEA with some attributes data provided within GAUL in a separate file. No data from outside GAUL have been used and it is possible to reconstruct the original dataset by removing the extra attributes added.","The overall methodology consists in 				  a) collecting the best available data from most reliable sources, 				  b) establishing validation periods of the geographic features (when possible), 				  c) adding selected data to the global layer based on the last country boundaries map provided by the UN Cartographic Unit (UNCS), 				  d) generating codes using the GAUL Coding System and e) distribute data to the users (see GAUL Doc01 Ver17.pdf) Because the GAUL works at global level, controversial boundaries can not be ignored. The approach of the GAUL is to maintain disputed areas in such a way to preserve national integrity for all disputing countries (see GAUL Doc01 Ver17.pdf and disputed_areas.dbf). The coastal line of the GAUL is mostly compliant with the coast of the International Boundary map delivered by UNCS except for some countries (e.g. Viet Nam, India, Bangaldesh, etc.) where it has been updated according to the satellite images (e.g. Landsat ETM). For the next releases of the GAUL, the updating process of the coast-line will go on, country by country, through a comparison with the satellite images.","urn:ogc:def:crs:OGP Surveying & Positioning Committee::urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG:7.1:4326","","","","","","","",Administrative units,boundaries]

With the help of CLC data it is possible to provide support for protecting ecosystems, halting the loss of biological diversity, tracking the impacts of climate change, assessing developments in agriculture and implementing the EU Water Framework Directive.   CLC data is an important data set for the implementation of key priority areas of the Sixth Environment Action Programme of the European Community. CLC data can show, for instance, where fragmentation of the landscape by roads and other infrastructure is worsening and thus increasing the risk that ecosystems can no longer connect with each other, putting the survival of their flora and fauna in danger. In the agricultural field CLC data can highlight where major structural changes are continuing or intensifying, such as the conversion of pasture to arable land, expansion or reduction in the area of fallow land and land taken out of production ('set aside'), or the abandonment of farming altogether. CLC serve as input to the EC 'Inspire' (INfrastructure for SPatial InfoRmation in Europe - http://inspire.jrc.it) initiative. This initiative intends to trigger the creation of a European spatial information infrastructure that delivers to the users integrated spatial information services. CLC programme is also a contribution to the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES http://gmes.info) initiative, run by the European Commission and the European Space Agency, to provide environmental information from a combination of air- and space-based observation systems and in-situ monitoring.","Product is based on CLC databases provided by National Teams within CLC mapping related projects (I&CLC2000, CARDS, FTSP/CLC2006 update etc..

LCEUGRIDS represent the final product of European CLC data integration. The process of data integration started when national CLC deliveries have been accepted. Delivered national data were produced in local national systems of all participating countries. Each national Coordinate Reference System (CRS) definition had to be known precisely together with its geometric relationship to a standard system in order to accurately transfer all national data into a standard coordinate reference (LAEA5210/ETRS89) for European wide geographic data. Mostly, the process itself was carried out by global equation-based transformation to ETRS89 (e.g. seven-parameters Bursa-Wolf methods). The accuracy of a particular transformation ranges from centimetres to meters depending on the method and the quality and number of control points available to define the transformation parameters, but, in any case, the accuracy is far above the actual CLC2000 data resolution (for more details see DBTA reports for particular country). Due to large data volume, national data, when transformed into the common European reference, are rasterized.
